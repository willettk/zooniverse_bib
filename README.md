==============

Bibliography for publications related to the Zooniverse

Contains bibliography files for manuscript use in multiple formats, including:

- BibTeX (*.bib)
- RIS (*.ris)
- EndNote (*.xml)

I manage these in the OS X BibDesk program, which can handle several other files - notify me by email if you're interested in alternative formats.
