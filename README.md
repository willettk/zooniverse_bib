zooniverse_bib
==============

Bibliography for publications generated by and related to [the Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/).

Contains bibliography files for manuscript use in multiple formats, including:

- BibTeX (*.bib)
- RIS (*.ris)
- EndNote (*.xml)

I manage these in the OS X BibDesk program, which can handle several other files - notify me in the issues if you're interested in alternative formats. 

As of 03 May 2016, the bibliography contained 122 references from 20 different projects. The list at [https://www.zooniverse.org/about/publications] is supplemented here by a few papers whose lead author is not on the main science team (but whose focus is Zooniverse data), or conference proceedings that aren't listed there. This is not an official list or endorsement of any particular publication (or lack thereof) - simply intended to be a useful resource to anyone trying to collect bibliographic information related to our projects.
