AB  - KIC 9406652 is a remarkable variable star in the Kepler field of view that shows both very rapid oscillations and long term outbursts in its light curve. We present an analysis of the light curve over quarters 1-15 and new spectroscopy that indicates that the object is a cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of 6.108 hr. However, an even stronger signal appears in the light curve periodogram for a shorter period of 5.753 hr, and we argue that this corresponds to the modulation of flux from the hot spot region in a tilted, precessing disk surrounding the white dwarf star. We present a preliminary orbital solution from radial velocity measurements of features from the accretion disk and the photosphere of the companion. We use a Doppler tomography algorithm to reconstruct the disk and companion spectra, and we also consider how these components contribute to the object's spectral energy distribution from ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths. This target offers us a remarkable opportunity to investigate disk processes during the high mass transfer stage of evolution in cataclysmic variables.  This work is based in part from the Planethunters.org Guest Observer program.

AB  - Over the duration of the Kepler mission, KIC 8462852 was observed to undergo irregularly shaped, aperiodic dips in flux down to below the 20% level. The dipping activity can last for between 5 and 80 days. We characterize the object with high-resolution spectroscopy, spectral energy distribution fitting, and Fourier analyses of the Kepler light curve. We determine that KIC 8462852 is a main-sequence F3 V/IV star, with a rotation period ~0.88 d, that exhibits no significant IR excess. In this paper, we describe various scenarios to explain the mysterious events in the Kepler light curve, most of which have problems explaining the data in hand. By considering the observational constraints on dust clumps orbiting a normal main-sequence star, we conclude that the scenario most consistent with the data is the passage of a family of exocomet fragments, all of which are associated with a single previous breakup event. We discuss the necessity of future observations to help interpret the system.

AB  - We investigate the development of scientific content knowledge of volunteers participating in online citizen science projects in the Zooniverse (www.zooniverse.org), including the astronomy projects Galaxy Zoo (www.galaxyzoo.org) and Planet Hunters (www.planethunters.org). We use econometric methods to test how measures of project participation relate to success in a science quiz, controlling for factors known to correlate with scientific knowledge. Citizen scientists believe they are learning about both the content and processes of science through their participation. Won't don't directly test the latter, but we find evidence to support the former - that more actively engaged participants perform better in a project-specific science knowledge quiz, even after controlling for their general science knowledge. We interpret this as evidence of learning of science content inspired by participation in online citizen science.

AB  - GEMS (Galaxy Evolution from Morphologies and SEDs) is a large-area (800 arcmin2) two-color (F606W and F850LP) imaging survey with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope. Centered on the Chandra Deep Field-South, it covers an area of ~28'×28', or about 120 Hubble Deep Field areas, to a depth of mAB(F606W)=28.3(5sigma) and mAB(F850LP)=27.1(5sigma) for compact sources. In its central ~1/4, GEMS incorporates ACS imaging from the GOODS project. Focusing on the redshift range 0.2<~z<~1.1, GEMS provides morphologies and structural parameters for nearly 10,000 galaxies where redshift estimates, luminosities, and SEDs exist from COMBO-17. At the same time, GEMS contains detectable host galaxy images for several hundred faint active galactic nuclei. This paper provides an overview of the science goals, the experiment design, the data reduction, and the science analysis plan for GEMS.

AB  - We provide observational and theoretical perspectives on the currently much debated issue of the Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological dichotomy of extragalactic radio sources. In this context we introduce a new, albeit rare, class of double radio sources in which the two lobes exhibit clearly different FR morphologies. It is argued that such `HYbrid MOrphology Radio Sources', or HYMORS, could be used to effectively constrain the theoretical mechanisms proposed for the FR dichotomy. Basically, the existence of HYMORS supports explanations for the FR dichotomy based upon jet interaction with the medium external to the central engine, and appears quite difficult to reconcile with the class of explanations that posit fundamental differences in the central engine, such as black hole spin or jet composition, to be responsible for the two FR classes of double radio sources.

AB  - The SIRTF Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE), the largest SIRTF Legacy program, is a wide-area imaging survey to trace the evolution of dusty, star-forming galaxies, evolved stellar populations, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as a function of environment, from redshifts z~3 to the current epoch. SWIRE will survey seven high-latitude fields, totaling 60-65 deg2 in all seven SIRTF bands: Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) 3.6, 4.5, 5.6, and 8 mum and Multiband Imaging Photometer for SIRTF (MIPS) 24, 70, and 160 mum. Extensive modeling suggests that the Legacy Extragalactic Catalog may contain in excess of 2 million IR-selected galaxies, dominated by (1) ~150,000 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs; LFIR>1011 Lsolar) detected by MIPS (and significantly more detected by IRAC), ~7000 of these with z>2 (2) 1 million IRAC-detected early-type galaxies (~2×105 with z>1 and ~10,000 with z>2) and (3) ~20,000 classical AGNs detected with MIPS, plus significantly more dust-obscured quasi-stellar objects/AGNs among the LIRGs. SWIRE will provide an unprecedented view of the evolution of galaxies, structure, and AGNs.  The key scientific goals of SWIRE are (1) to determine the evolution of actively star forming and passively evolving galaxies in order to understand the history of galaxy formation in the context of cosmic structure formation; (2) to determine the evolution of the spatial distribution and clustering of evolved galaxies, starbursts, and AGNs in the key redshift range 0.5<z<3 over which much of cosmic evolution has occurred; and (3) to determine the evolutionary relationship between ``normal galaxies'' and AGNs and the contribution of AGN accretion energy versus stellar nucleosynthesis to the cosmic backgrounds. The large area of SWIRE is important to establish statistically significant population samples over enough volume cells that we can resolve the star formation history as a function of epoch and environment, i.e., in the context of structure formation. The large volume is also optimized for finding rare objects.  The SWIRE fields are likely to become the next generation of large ``cosmic windows'' into the extragalactic sky. They have been uniquely selected to minimize Galactic cirrus emission over large scales. The Galaxy Evolution Explorer will observe them as part of its deep 100 deg2 survey, as will Herschel. SWIRE includes ~9 deg2 of the unique large-area XMM Large Scale Structure hard X-ray imaging survey and is partly covered by the UKIDSS deep J and K survey. An extensive optical/near-IR imaging program is underway from the ground.  The SWIRE data are nonproprietary; catalogs and images will be released twice yearly, beginning about 11 months after SIRTF launch. Details of the data products and release schedule are presented.

The AllWISE program extends the work of the successful Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission by combining data from the cryogenic and post-cryogenic survey phases to form the most comprehensive view of the mid-infrared sky currently available. AllWISE has produced a new Source Catalog and Image Atlas with enhanced sensitivity and accuracy compared with earlier WISE data releases. Advanced data processing for AllWISE exploits the two complete sky coverages to measure source motions for each Catalog source, and to compile a massive database of light curves for those objects.

AB  - Current wide-area radio surveys are dominated by active galactic nuclei, yet many of these sources have no identified optical counterparts. Here we investigate whether one can constrain the nature and properties of these sources, using Fanaroff-Riley type II (FR II) radio galaxies as probes. These sources are easy to identify since the angular separation of their lobes remains almost constant at some tens of arcseconds for z > 1. Using a simple algorithm applied to the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm survey, we obtain the largest FR II sample to date, containing over 104 double-lobed sources. A subset of 459 sources is matched to Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars. This sample yields a statistically meaningful description of the fraction of quasars with lobes as a function of redshift and luminosity. This relation is combined with the bolometric quasar luminosity function and a disc-lobe correlation to obtain a robust prediction for the density of FR IIs on the radio sky. We find that the observed density can be explained by the population of known quasars, implying that the majority of powerful jets originate from a radiatively efficient accretion flow with a linear jet-disc coupling. Finally, we show that high-redshift jets are more often quenched within 100 kpc, suggesting a higher efficiency of jet-induced feedback into their host galaxies.

AB  - At very low frequencies, the new pan-European radio telescope LOFAR is opening the last unexplored window of the electromagnetic spectrum for astrophysical studies. The revolutionary APERTIF- phased arrays that are about to be installed on the Westerbork radio telescope (WSRT) will dramatically increase the survey speed for the WSRT. Combined surveys with these two facilities will deeply chart the northern sky over almost two decades in radio frequency from ˜15 up to 1400 MHz. Here we briefly describe some of the capabilities of these new facilities and what radio surveys are planned to study fun-damental issues related to the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. In the second part we briefly review some recent observational results directly showing that diffuse radio emission in clusters traces shocks due to cluster mergers. As these diffuse radio sources are relatively bright at low frequencies, LOFAR should be able to detect thousands of such sources up to the epoch of cluster formation. This will allow addressing many question about the origin and evolution of shocks and magnetic fields in clusters. At the end we briefly review some of the first and very preliminary LOFAR results on clusters.

AB  - We present results from the first 12 months of operation of Radio Galaxy Zoo, which upon completion will enable visual inspection of over 170 000 radio sources to determine the host galaxy of the radio emission and the radio morphology. Radio Galaxy Zoo uses 1.4 GHz radio images from both the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) in combination with mid-infrared images at 3.4 mum from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and at 3.6 mum from the Spitzer Space Telescope. We present the early analysis of the WISE mid-infrared colours of the host galaxies. For images in which there is >75 per cent consensus among the Radio Galaxy Zoo cross-identifications, the project participants are as effective as the science experts at identifying the host galaxies. The majority of the identified host galaxies reside in the mid-infrared colour space dominated by elliptical galaxies, quasi-stellar objects and luminous infrared radio galaxies. We also find a distinct population of Radio Galaxy Zoo host galaxies residing in a redder mid-infrared colour space consisting of star-forming galaxies and/or dust-enhanced non-star-forming galaxies consistent with a scenario of merger-driven active galactic nuclei (AGN) formation. The completion of the full Radio Galaxy Zoo project will measure the relative populations of these hosts as a function of radio morphology and power while providing an avenue for the identification of rare and extreme radio structures. Currently, we are investigating candidates for radio galaxies with extreme morphologies, such as giant radio galaxies, late-type host galaxies with extended radio emission and hybrid morphology radio sources.

AB  - Context: For more than two decades we have known that galaxy morphological segregation is present in the Local Universe. It is important to see how this relation evolves with cosmic time.   Aims: To investigate how galaxy assembly took place with cosmic time, we explore the evolution of the morphology-density relation up to redshift z ~ 1 using about 10 000 galaxies drawn from the zCOSMOS Galaxy Redshift Survey. Taking advantage of accurate HST/ACS morphologies from the COSMOS survey, of the well-characterised zCOSMOS 3D environment, and of a large sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, we want to study here the evolution of the morphology-density relation up to z ~ 1 and its dependence on galaxy luminosity and stellar mass. The multi-wavelength coverage of the field also allows a first study of the galaxy morphological segregation dependence on colour. We further attempt to disentangle between processes that occurred early in the history of the Universe or late in the life of galaxies.  Methods: The zCOSMOS field benefits of high-resolution imaging in the F814W filter from the Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS). We use standard morphology classifiers, optimised for being robust against band-shifting and surface brightness dimming, and a new, objective, and automated method to convert morphological parameters into early, spiral, and irregular types. We use about 10 000 galaxies down to I_AB = 22.5 with a spectroscopic sampling rate of 33% to characterise the environment of galaxies up to z ~ 1 from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 Mpc scales of the cosmic web. The evolution of the morphology-density relation in different environments is then studied for luminosity and stellar-mass selected, volume-limited samples of galaxies. The trends are described and related to the various physical processes that could play a relevant role in the build-up of the morphology-density relation.  Results: We confirm that the morphological segregation is present up to z ~ 1 for luminosity-selected, volume-limited samples. The behaviour of the morphology-density relation gets flatter at fixed masses expecially above 1010.6 M&sun;. We suggest the existence of a critical mass above which the physical processes governing galaxy stellar mass also determine the shaping of the galaxy more than its environment. We finally show that at a fixed morphology there is still a residual variation in galaxy colours with density.   Conclusions: The observed evolution with redshift of the morphology-density relation offers an opportunity to trace the effect of nature and nurture as a function of environment. Even though it is based mainly on a biased view, the environmental dependence of the morphological evolution for luminosity-selected, volume-limited samples seems to indicate that nurture is in play. On the other hand, the lack of evolution observed for early-type and spiral galaxies that are more massive than 1010.8 M&sun; independents of the environment indicates that nature has imprinted these properties early in the life of these galaxies. We conclude that the relative contribution of nature and nurture in different environments strongly depends on the mass of galaxies, consistent with a downsizing scenario.  Based on observations obtained at the European Southern  Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT), Paranal, Chile, as part of the  Large Program 175.A-0839 (the zCOSMOS Spectroscopic Redshift Survey).

AB  - Atmospheric turbulence distorts all ground-based observations, which is especially detrimental to faint detections. The point spread function (PSF) defining this blur is unknown for each exposure and varies significantly over time, making image analysis difficult. Lucky imaging and traditional co-adding throws away lots of information. We developed blind deconvolution algorithms that can simultaneously obtain robust solutions for the background image and all the PSFs. It is done in a streaming setting, which makes it practical for large number of big images. We implemented a new tool that runs of GPUs and achieves exceptional running times that can scale to the new time-domain surveys. Our code can quickly and effectively recover high-resolution images exceeding the quality of traditional co-adds. We demonstrate the power of the method on the repeated exposures in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Stripe 82.

AB  - We have undertaken an ambitious program to visually classify all galaxies in the five CANDELS fields down to H < 24.5 involving the dedicated efforts of over 65 individual classifiers. Once completed, we expect to have detailed morphological classifications for over 50,000 galaxies spanning 0 < z < 4 over all the fields, with classifications from 3 to 5 independent classifiers for each galaxy. Here, we present our detailed visual classification scheme, which was designed to cover a wide range of CANDELS science goals. This scheme includes the basic Hubble sequence types, but also includes a detailed look at mergers and interactions, the clumpiness of galaxies, k-corrections, and a variety of other structural properties. In this paper, we focus on the first field to be completed---GOODS-S, which has been classified at various depths. The wide area coverage spanning the full field (wide+deep+ERS) includes 7634 galaxies that have been classified by at least three different people. In the deep area of the field, 2534 galaxies have been classified by at least five different people at three different depths. With this paper, we release to the public all of the visual classifications in GOODS-S along with the Perl/Tk GUI that we developed to classify galaxies. We present our initial results here, including an analysis of our internal consistency and comparisons among multiple classifiers as well as a comparison to the Sérsic index. We find that the level of agreement among classifiers is quite good (>70% across the full magnitude range) and depends on both the galaxy magnitude and the galaxy type, with disks showing the highest level of agreement (>50%) and irregulars the lowest (<10%). A comparison of our classifications with the Sérsic index and rest-frame colors shows a clear separation between disk and spheroid populations. Finally, we explore morphological k-corrections between the V-band and H-band observations and find that a small fraction (84 galaxies in total) are classified as being very different between these two bands. These galaxies typically have very clumpy and extended morphology or are very faint in the V-band.

AB  - We have performed two-dimensional multicomponent decomposition of 144 local barred spiral galaxies using 3.6 mum images from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies. Our model fit includes up to four components (bulge, disk, bar, and a point source) and, most importantly, takes into account disk breaks. We find that ignoring the disk break and using a single disk scale length in the model fit for Type II (down-bending) disk galaxies can lead to differences of 40% in the disk scale length, 10% in bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T), and 25% in bar-to-total luminosity ratios. We find that for galaxies with B/T >= 0.1, the break radius to bar radius, r br/R bar, varies between 1 and 3, but as a function of B/T the ratio remains roughly constant. This suggests that in bulge-dominated galaxies the disk break is likely related to the outer Lindblad resonance of the bar and thus moves outward as the bar grows. For galaxies with small bulges, B/T < 0.1, r br/R bar spans a wide range from 1 to 6. This suggests that the mechanism that produces the break in these galaxies may be different from that in galaxies with more massive bulges. Consistent with previous studies, we conclude that disk breaks in galaxies with small bulges may originate from bar resonances that may be also coupled with the spiral arms, or be related to star formation thresholds.

AB  - We report the discovery of 29 promising (and 59 total) new lens candidates from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) based on about 11 million classifications performed by citizen scientists as part of the first SPACE WARPS lens search. The goal of the blind lens search was to identify lens candidates missed by robots (the RINGFINDER on galaxy scales and ARCFINDER on group/cluster scales) which had been previously used to mine the CFHTLS for lenses. We compare some properties of the samples detected by these algorithms to the SPACE WARPS sample and find them to be broadly similar. The image separation distribution calculated from the SPACE WARPS sample shows that previous constraints on the average density profile of lens galaxies are robust. SPACE WARPS recovers about 65 per cent of known lenses, while the new candidates show a richer variety compared to those found by the two robots. This detection rate could be increased to 80 per cent by only using classifications performed by expert volunteers (albeit at the cost of a lower purity), indicating that the training and performance calibration of the citizen scientists is very important for the success of SPACE WARPS. In this work we present the SIMCT pipeline, used for generating in situ a sample of realistic simulated lensed images. This training sample, along with the false positives identified during the search, has a legacy value for testing future lens-finding algorithms. We make the pipeline and the training set publicly available.

AB  - We describe SPACE WARPS, a novel gravitational lens discovery service that yields samples of high purity and completeness through crowdsourced visual inspection. Carefully produced colour composite images are displayed to volunteers via a web-based classification interface, which records their estimates of the positions of candidate lensed features. Images of simulated lenses, as well as real images which lack lenses, are inserted into the image stream at random intervals; this training set is used to give the volunteers instantaneous feedback on their performance, as well as to calibrate a model of the system that provides dynamical updates to the probability that a classified image contains a lens. Low-probability systems are retired from the site periodically, concentrating the sample towards a set of lens candidates. Having divided 160 deg2 of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey imaging into some 430 000 overlapping 82 by 82 arcsec tiles and displaying them on the site, we were joined by around 37 000 volunteers who contributed 11 million image classifications over the course of eight months. This stage 1 search reduced the sample to 3381 images containing candidates; these were then refined in stage 2 to yield a sample that we expect to be over 90 per cent complete and 30 per cent pure, based on our analysis of the volunteers performance on training images. We comment on the scalability of the SPACE WARPS system to the wide field survey era, based on our projection that searches of 105 images could be performed by a crowd of 105 volunteers in 6 d.

AB  - We review the expanding, internet-enabled, and rapidly evolving field of citizen astronomy, focusing on research projects in stellar, extragalactic, and planetary science that have benefited from the participation of members of the public. These volunteers contribute in various ways: making and analyzing new observations, visually classifying features in images and light curves, exploring models constrained by astronomical data sets, and initiating new scientific enquiries. The most productive citizen astronomy projects involve close collaboration between the professionals and amateurs involved and occupy scientific niches not easily filled by great observatories or machine learning methods: Citizen astronomers are motivated by being of service to science, as well as by their interest in the subject. We expect participation and productivity in citizen astronomy to increase, as data sets get larger and citizen science platforms become more efficient. Opportunities include engaging citizens in ever-more advanced analyses and facilitating citizen-led enquiry through professional tools designed with citizens in mind.

AB  - Energetic feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is an important ingredient for regulating the star-formation history of galaxies in models of galaxy formation, which makes it important to study how AGN feedback actually occurs in practice. In order to catch AGNs in the act of quenching star formation we have used the interstellar NaD absorption lines to look for cold-gas outflows in a sample of 456 nearby galaxies for which we could unambigously ascertain the presence of radio AGN activity, thanks to radio imaging at milli-arcsecond scales. While compact radio emission indicating a radio AGN was found in 103 galaxies (23% of the sample), and 23 objects (5%) exhibited NaD absorption-line kinematics suggestive of cold-gas outflows, not one object showed evidence of a radio AGN and of a cold-gas outflow simultaneously. Radio AGN activity was found predominantly in early-type galaxies, while cold-gas outflows were mainly seen in spiral galaxies with central star-formation or composite star-formation/AGN activity. Optical AGNs also do not seem capable of driving galactic winds in our sample. Our work adds to a picture of the low-redshift Universe where cold-gas outflows in massive galaxies are generally driven by star formation and where radio-AGN activity occurs most often in systems in which the gas reservoir has already been significantly depleted.

AB  - We report the discovery of spiral galaxies that are as optically luminous as elliptical brightest cluster galaxies, with r-band monochromatic luminosity L_r=8-14L* (4.3-7.5E44 erg/s). These super spiral galaxies are also giant and massive, with diameter D=57-134 kpc and stellar mass M_stars=0.3-3.4E11 M_sun. We find 53 super spirals out of a complete sample of 1,616 SDSS galaxies with redshift z<0.3 and L_r>8L*. The closest example is found at z=0.089. We use existing photometry to estimate their stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). The SDSS and WISE colors are consistent with normal star-forming spirals on the blue sequence. However, the extreme masses and rapid SFRs of 5-65 M_sun/yr place super spirals in a sparsely populated region of parameter space, above the star-forming main sequence of disk galaxies. Super spirals occupy a diverse range of environments, from isolation to cluster centers. We find four super spiral galaxy systems that are late-stage major mergers--a possible clue to their formation. We suggest that super spirals are a remnant population of unquenched, massive disk galaxies. They may eventually become massive lenticular galaxies after they are cut off from their gas supply and their disks fade.

AB  - The prevalence of radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in present-day massive haloes is determined using a sample of 625 nearby groups and clusters selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Brightest group and cluster galaxies (BCGs) are more likely to host a radio-loud AGN than other galaxies of the same stellar mass (by below a factor of 2 at a stellar mass of ~5 × 1011Msolar, but rising to over an order of magnitude below 1011Msolar). The distribution of radio luminosities for BCGs does not depend on mass, however, and is similar to that of field galaxies of the same stellar mass. Neither the radio-loud fraction nor the radio luminosity distribution of BCGs depends strongly on the velocity dispersion of the host cluster. The radio-AGN fraction is also studied as a function of distance from the cluster centre. Only within 0.2r200 do cluster galaxies exhibit an enhanced likelihood of radio-loud AGN activity, which approaches that of the BCGs. In contrast to the radio properties, the fraction of galaxies with optical emission-line AGN activity is suppressed within r200 in groups and clusters, decreasing monotonically towards the cluster centre.  It is argued that the radio-loud AGN properties of both BCGs and non-BCGs can naturally be explained if this activity is fuelled by cooling from hot gas surrounding the galaxy. Using observational estimates of the mechanical output of the radio jets, the time-averaged energy output associated with recurrent radio source activity is estimated for all group and cluster galaxies. Within the cooling radius of the cluster, the radio-mode heating associated with the BCG dominates over that of all other galaxies combined. The scaling between total radio-AGN energy output and cluster velocity dispersion is observed to be considerably shallower than the ~sigma4v scaling of the radiative cooling rate. Thus, unless either the mechanical-to-radio luminosity ratio or the efficiency of converting AGN mechanical energy into heating increases by 2-3 orders of magnitude between groups and rich clusters, radio-mode heating will not balance radiative cooling in systems of all masses. In groups, radio-AGN heating probably overcompensates the radiative cooling losses, and this may account for the observed entropy floor in these systems. In the most massive clusters, an additional heating process (most likely thermal conduction) may be required to supplement the AGN heating.

AB  - As the most common environment in the universe, groups of galaxies are likely to contain a significant fraction of the missing baryons in the form of intergalactic gas. The density of this gas is an important factor in whether ram pressure stripping and strangulation affect the evolution of galaxies in these systems. We present a method for measuring the density of intergalactic gas using bent-double radio sources that is independent of temperature, making it complementary to current absorption-line measurements. We use this method to probe intergalactic gas in two different environments, inside a small group of galaxies as well as outside of a larger group at a 2 Mpc radius, and measure total gas densities of 4+/-1+6-2×10-3 cm-3 and 9+/-3+10-5×10-4 cm-3 (random and systematic errors), respectively. We use X-ray data to place an upper limit of 2×106 K on the temperature of the intragroup gas in the small group.

AB  - We present reduced data and data products from the 3D-HST survey, a 248-orbit HST Treasury program. The survey obtained WFC3 G141 grism spectroscopy in four of the five CANDELS fields: AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS, along with WFC3 $H_140$ imaging, parallel ACS G800L spectroscopy, and parallel $I_814$ imaging. In a previous paper (Skelton et al. 2014) we presented photometric catalogs in these four fields and in GOODS-N, the fifth CANDELS field. Here we describe and present the WFC3 G141 spectroscopic data, again augmented with data from GO-1600 in GOODS-N. The data analysis is complicated by the fact that no slits are used: all objects in the WFC3 field are dispersed, and many spectra overlap. We developed software to automatically and optimally extract interlaced 2D and 1D spectra for all objects in the Skelton et al. (2014) photometric catalogs. The 2D spectra and the multi-band photometry were fit simultaneously to determine redshifts and emission line strengths, taking the morphology of the galaxies explicitly into account. The resulting catalog has 98,663 measured redshifts and line strengths down to $JH_IR\leq 26$ and 22,548 with $JH_IR\leq 24$, where we comfortably detect continuum emission. Of this sample 5,459 galaxies are at $z>1.5$ and 9,621 are at $0.7<z<1.5$, where H$\alpha$ falls in the G141 wavelength coverage. Based on comparisons with ground-based spectroscopic redshifts, and on analyses of paired galaxies and repeat observations, the typical redshift error for $JH_IR\leq 24$ galaxies in our catalog is $\sigma_z \approx 0.003 \times (1+z)$, i.e., one native WFC3 pixel. The $3\sigma$ limit for emission line fluxes of point sources is $1.5\times10^-17$ ergs s$^-1$ cm$^-2$. We show various representations of the full dataset, as well as individual examples that highlight the range of spectra that we find in the survey.

AB  - We present a pair of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of intermittent jets from a central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in a galaxy cluster extracted from a high-resolution cosmological simulation. The selected cluster was chosen as an apparently relatively relaxed system, not having undergone a major merger in almost 7 Gyr. Despite this characterization and history, the intracluster medium (ICM) contains quite active "weather." We explore the effects of this ICM weather on the morphological evolution of the AGN jets and lobes. The orientation of the jets is different in the two simulations so that they probe different aspects of the ICM structure and dynamics. We find that even for this cluster, which can be characterized as relaxed by an observational standard, the large-scale, bulk ICM motions can significantly distort the jets and lobes. Synthetic X-ray observations of the simulations show that the jets produce complex cavity systems, while synthetic radio observations reveal bending of the jets and lobes similar to wide-angle tail radio sources. The jets are cycled on and off with a 26 Myr period using a 50% duty cycle. This leads to morphological features similar to those in "double-double" radio galaxies. While the jet and ICM magnetic fields are generally too weak in the simulations to play a major role in the dynamics, Maxwell stresses can still become locally significant.

AB  - We are conducting a large survey of distant clusters of galaxies using radio sources with bent jets and lobes as tracers. These radio sources are driven by AGN and achieve their bent morphologies through interaction with the surrounding gas found in clusters of galaxies. Based on low-redshift studies, these types of sources can be used to identify clusters very efficiently. We present initial results from our survey of 653 bent-double radio sources with optical hosts too faint to appear in the SDSS. The sample was observed in the infrared with Spitzer, and it has revealed ~200 distant clusters or proto-clusters in the redshift range z ~ 0.7 - 3.0. The sample of bent-doubles contains both quasars and radio galaxies enabling us to study both radiative and kinetic mode feedback in cluster and group environments at a wide range of redshifts.

AB  - We present the third data release from the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey. These data combine the observations at 1.4 GHz before and after upgrades to the Australia Telescope Compact Array reaching a sensitivity of 14 muJy beam-1 in 3.6 deg2 over the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and of 17 muJy beam-1 in 2.7 deg2 over the European Large Area ISO Survey South 1 (ELAIS-S1). We used a variety of array configurations to maximize the uv coverage resulting in a resolution of 16 by 7 arcsec in CDFS and of 12 by 8 arcsec in ELAIS-S1. After correcting for peak bias and bandwidth smearing, we find a total of 3034 radio source components above 5sigma in CDFS, of which 514 (17 per cent) are considered to be extended. The number of components detected above 5sigma in ELAIS-S1 is 2084, of which 392 (19 per cent) are classified as extended. The catalogues include reliable spectral indices (Deltaalpha < 0.2) between 1.40 and 1.71 GHz for ˜350 of the brightest components.

AB  - Cross-matching catalogues at different wavelengths is a difficult problem in astronomy, especially when the objects are not point-like. At radio wavelengths, an object can have several components corresponding, for example, to a core and lobes. Considering not all radio detections correspond to visible or infrared sources, matching these catalogues can be challenging. Traditionally, this is done by eye for better quality, which does not scale to the large data volumes expected from the next-generation of radio telescopes. We present a novel automated procedure, using Bayesian hypothesis testing, to achieve reliable associations by explicit modelling of a particular class of radio-source morphology. The new algorithm not only assesses the likelihood of an association between data at two different wavelengths, but also tries to assess whether different radio sources are physically associated, are double-lobed radio galaxies, or just distinct nearby objects. Application to the Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic and Australia Telescope Large Area Survey CDF-S catalogues shows that this method performs well without human intervention.

AB  - The morphology of selected groups of sources in the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) survey and catalog is examined. Sources in the FIRST catalog (2003 April release, 811,117 entries) were sorted into singles, doubles, triples, and groups of higher-count membership based on a proximity criteria. The 7106 groups with four or more components were examined individually for bent types including, but not limited to, wide-angle tail and narrow-angle tail types. In the process of this examination, ring, double-double, X-shaped, hybrid morphology, giant radio sources, and the herein described W-shaped and tri-axial morphology systems were also identified. For the convenience of the reader separate tables for distinctive types were generated. A few curiosities were found. For the 16,950 three-component groups and 74,788 two-component groups, catalogs with probability estimates for bent classification, as determined by pattern recognition techniques, are presented.

AB  - We study the slope, intercept, and scatter of the color-magnitude and color-mass relations for a sample of ten infrared red-sequence-selected clusters at z ~ 1. The quiescent galaxies in these clusters formed the bulk of their stars above z ~ 3 with an age spread \Deltat ~ 1 Gyr. We compare UVJ color-color and spectroscopic-based galaxy selection techniques, and find a 15% difference in the galaxy populations classified as quiescent by these methods. We compare the color-magnitude relations from our red-sequence selected sample with X-ray- and photometric- redshift-selected cluster samples of similar mass and redshift. Within uncertainties, we are unable to detect any difference in the ages and star formation histories of quiescent cluster members in clusters selected by different methods, suggesting that the dominant quenching mechanism is insensitive to cluster baryon partitioning at z ~ 1.

AB  - The increasing abundance of passive "red-sequence" galaxies since z ~ 1-2 is mirrored by a coincident rise in the number of galaxies with spheroidal morphologies. In this paper, however, we show in detail, that, the correspondence between galaxy morphology and color is not perfect, providing insight into the physical origin of this evolution. Using the COSMOS survey, we study a significant population of red-sequence galaxies with disk-like morphologies. These passive disks typically have Sa-Sb morphological types with large bulges, but they are not confined to dense environments. They represent nearly one-half of all red-sequence galaxies and dominate at lower masses (lsim1010 M sun) where they are increasingly disk-dominated. As a function of time, the abundance of passive disks with M * <~ 1011 M sun increases, but not as fast as red-sequence spheroidals in the same mass range. At higher mass, the passive disk population has declined since z ~ 1, likely because they transform into spheroidals. Based on these trends, we estimate that as much as 60% of galaxies transitioning onto the red sequence evolve through a passive disk phase. The origin of passive disks therefore has broad implications for our understanding of how star formation shuts down. Because passive disks tend to be more bulge-dominated than their star-forming counterparts, a simple fading of blue disks does not fully explain their origin. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of several more sophisticated explanations, including environmental effects, internal stabilization, and disk regrowth during gas-rich mergers. While previous work has sought to explain color and morphological transformations with a single process, these observations open the way to new insight by highlighting the fact that galaxy evolution may actually proceed through several separate stages.

AB  - Double-lobe radio galaxies in the local Universe have traditionally been found to be hosted in elliptical or lenticular galaxies. We report the discovery of four spiral-host double-lobe radio galaxies (J0836+0532, J1159+5820, J1352+3126 and J1649+2635) that are discovered by cross-matching a large sample of 187005 spiral galaxies from SDSS DR7 to the full catalogues of FIRST and NVSS. J0836+0532 is reported for the first time. The host galaxies are forming stars at an average rate of 1.7 $-$ 10 M$_\odot$ yr$^-1$ and possess Super Massive Black Holes (SMBHs) with masses of a few times 10$^8$ M$_\odot$. Their radio morphologies are similar to FR-II radio galaxies with total projected linear sizes ranging from 86 kpc to 420 kpc, but their total 1.4 GHz radio luminosities are only in the range 10$^24$ $-$ 10$^25$ W Hz$^-1$. We propose that the formation of spiral-host double-lobe radio galaxies can be attributed to more than one factor, such as the occurrence of strong interactions, mergers, and the presence of unusually massive SMBHs, such that the spiral structures are not destroyed. Only one of our sources (J1649+2635) is found in a cluster environment, indicating that processes other than accretion through cooling flows e.g., galaxy-galaxy mergers or interactions could be plausible scenarios for triggering radio-loud AGN activity in spiral galaxies.

AB  - We present a catalogue of 2D, point spread function-corrected de Vacouleurs, Sérsic, de Vacouleurs+Exponential, and Sérsic+Exponential fits of ˜7 × 105 spectroscopically selected galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7. Fits are performed for the SDSS r band utilizing the fitting routine GALFIT and analysis pipeline PYMORPH. We compare these fits to prior catalogues. Fits are analysed using a physically motivated flagging system. The flags suggest that more than 90 per cent of two-component fits can be used for analysis. We show that the fits follow the expected behaviour for early and late galaxy types. The catalogues provide a robust set of structural and photometric parameters for future galaxy studies. We show that some biases remain in the measurements, e.g. the presence of bars significantly affect the bulge measurements although the bulge ellipticity may be used to separate barred and non-barred galaxies, and about 15 per cent of bulges of two-component fits are also affected by resolution. The catalogues are available in electronic format. We also provide an interface for generating postage stamp images of the 2D model and residual as well as the 1D profile. These images can be generated for a user-uploaded list of galaxies on demand.

AB  - Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Array Camera imaging provides an opportunity to study all known morphological types of galaxies in the mid-IR at a depth significantly better than ground-based near-infrared and optical images. The goal of this study is to examine the imprint of the de Vaucouleurs classification volume in the 3.6 mum band, which is the best Spitzer waveband for galactic stellar mass morphology owing to its depth and its reddening-free sensitivity mainly to older stars. For this purpose, we have prepared classification images for 207 galaxies from the Spitzer archive, most of which are formally part of the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G), a Spitzer post-cryogenic ("warm") mission Exploration Science Legacy Program survey of 2331 galaxies closer than 40 Mpc. For the purposes of morphology, the galaxies are interpreted as if the images are blue light, the historical waveband for classical galaxy classification studies. We find that 3.6 mum classifications are well correlated with blue-light classifications, to the point where the essential features of many galaxies look very similar in the two very different wavelength regimes. Drastic differences are found only for the most dusty galaxies. Consistent with a previous study by Eskridge et al., the main difference between blue-light and mid-IR types is an ≈1 stage interval difference for S0/a to Sbc or Sc galaxies, which tend to appear "earlier" in type at 3.6 mum due to the slightly increased prominence of the bulge, the reduced effects of extinction, and the reduced (but not completely eliminated) effect of the extreme population I stellar component. We present an atlas of all of the 207 galaxies analyzed here and bring attention to special features or galaxy types, such as nuclear rings, pseudobulges, flocculent spiral galaxies, I0 galaxies, double-stage and double-variety galaxies, and outer rings, that are particularly distinctive in the mid-IR.

AB  - It is well established that (1) star-forming galaxies follow a relation between their star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M$_\star$), the "star-formation sequence", and (2) the SFRs of galaxies correlate with their structure, where star-forming galaxies are less concentrated than quiescent galaxies at fixed mass. Here, we consider whether the scatter and slope of the star-formation sequence is correlated with systematic variations in the Sersic indices, $n$, of galaxies across the SFR-M$_\star$ plane. We use a mass-complete sample of 23,848 galaxies at $0.5<z<2.5$ selected from the 3D-HST photometric catalogs. Galaxy light profiles parameterized by $n$ are based on Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS near-infrared imaging. We use a single SFR indicator empirically-calibrated from stacks of Spitzer/MIPS 24$\mu$m imaging, adding the unobscured and obscured star formation. We find that the scatter of the star-formation sequence is related in part to galaxy structure; the scatter due to variations in $n$ at fixed mass for star-forming galaxies ranges from 0.14$\pm$0.02 dex at $z\sim2$ to 0.30$\pm$0.04 dex at $z<1$. While the slope of the log(SFR)-log(M$_\star$) relation is of order unity for disk-like galaxies, galaxies with $n>2$ (implying more dominant bulges) have significantly lower SFR/M$_\star$ than the main ridgeline of the star-formation sequence. These results suggest that bulges in massive $z\sim2$ galaxies are actively building up, where the stars in the central concentration are relatively young. At $z<1$, the presence of older bulges within star-forming galaxies lowers global SFR/M$_\star$, decreasing the slope and contributing significantly to the scatter of the star-formation sequence.

The authors apply this framework to a sample of projects that form part of the online Zooniverse platform and position these projects against a success matrix that measures both contribution to science and public engagement levels relative to other projects in the sample. Their results indicate that better-performing projects tend to be those that are more established, as well as those in the area of astronomy. Implications for citizen science practitioners include the need to consider the impact of core competencies on project performance, as well as the importance of relationships between the central organization and science teams.

AB  - We discuss the observational evidences of the morphological transformation of Spirals into S0 galaxies in the cluster environment exploiting two big databases of galaxy clusters: WINGS (0.04 < z < 0.07) and EDisCS (0.4 < z < 0.8). The most important results are: 1) the average number of S0 galaxies in clusters is almost a factor of $\sim 3 - 4$ larger today than at redshift $z \sim 1$; 2) the fraction of S0's to Spirals increases on average by a factor $\sim$ 2 every Gyr; 3) the average rate of transformation for Spirals (not considering the infall of new galaxies from the cosmic web) is: $\sim$ 5 Sp into S0's per Gyr and $\sim$ 2 Sp into E's per Gyr; 4) there are evidences that the interstellar gas of Spirals is stripped by an hot intergalactic medium; 5) there are also indirect hints that major/minor merging events have played a role in the transformation of Spiral galaxies. In particular, we show that: 1) the ratio between the number of S0's and Spirals (NS0/NSp) in the WINGS clusters is correlated with their X-ray luminosity $L_X$ ; 2) that the brightest and massive S0's are always close to the cluster center; 3) that the mean Sersic index of S0's is always larger than that of Spirals (and lower than E's) for galaxy stellar masses above $10^9.5$ Msun; 4) that the number of E's in clusters cannot be constant; 5) that the largest difference between the mean mass of S0's and E's with respect to Spirals is observed in clusters with low velocity dispersion. Finally, by comparing the properties of the various morphological types for galaxies in clusters and in the field, we find that the most significant effect of the environment is the stripping of the outer galaxy regions, resulting in a systematic difference in effective radius and Sersic index.

AB  - Using the photometric redshifts of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), we identify 132,684 clusters in the redshift range of 0.05 <= z < 0.8. Monte Carlo simulations show that the false detection rate is less than 6% for the whole sample. The completeness is more than 95% for clusters with a mass of M 200 > 1.0 × 1014 M &sun; in the redshift range of 0.05 <= z < 0.42, while clusters of z > 0.42 are less complete and have a biased smaller richness than the real one due to incompleteness of member galaxies. We compare our sample with other cluster samples, and find that more than 90% of previously known rich clusters of 0.05 <= z < 0.42 are matched with clusters in our sample. Richer clusters tend to have more luminous brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Correlating with X-ray and the Planck data, we show that the cluster richness is closely related to the X-ray luminosity, temperature, and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements. Comparison of the BCGs with the SDSS luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample shows that 25% of LRGs are BCGs of our clusters and 36% of LRGs are cluster member galaxies. In our cluster sample, 63% of BCGs of r petro < 19.5 satisfy the SDSS LRG selection criteria.

AB  - Selecting centrally quiescent galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to create high signal-to-noise ratio (≳ 100 Å-1) stacked spectra with minimal emission-line contamination, we accurately and precisely model the central stellar populations of barred and unbarred quiescent disk galaxies. By splitting our sample by redshift, we can use the fixed size of the SDSS fiber to model the stellar populations at different radii within galaxies. At 0.02\lt z\lt 0.04, the SDSS fiber radius corresponds to ≈1 kpc, which is the typical half-light radii of both classical bulges and disky pseudobulges. Assuming that the SDSS fiber primarily covers the bulges at these redshifts, our analysis shows that there are no significant differences in the stellar populations, i.e., stellar age, [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [N/Fe], of the bulges of barred versus unbarred quiescent disk galaxies. Modeling the stellar populations at different redshift intervals from z = 0.020 to z = 0.085 at fixed stellar masses produces an estimate of the stellar population gradients out to about half the typical effective radius of our sample, assuming null evolution over this ≈1 Gyr epoch. We find that there are no noticeable differences in the slopes of the azimuthally averaged gradients of barred versus unbarred quiescent disk galaxies. These results suggest that bars are not a strong influence on the chemical evolution of quiescent disk galaxies.

AB  - We present the methodology for "blind" millimeter-wave surveys for redshifted molecular absorption in the CO/HCO+ rotational lines. The frequency range 30-50 GHz appears optimal for such surveys, providing sensitivity to absorbers at z >~ 0.85. It is critical that the survey is "blind," i.e., based on a radio-selected sample, including sources without known redshifts. We also report results from the first large survey of this kind, using the Q-band receiver on the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for molecular absorption toward 36 sources, 3 without known redshifts, over the frequency range 39.6-49.5 GHz. The GBT survey has a total redshift path of Deltaz ≈ 24, mostly at 0.81 < z < 1.91, and a sensitivity sufficient to detect equivalent H2 column densities >~ 3 × 1021 cm-2 in absorption at 5sigma significance (using CO-to-H2 and HCO+-to-H2 conversion factors of the Milky Way). The survey yielded no confirmed detections of molecular absorption, yielding the 2sigma upper limit n(z = 1.2) < 0.15 on the redshift number density of molecular gas at column densities N(H2) >~ 3 × 1021 cm-2.

AB  - We present improved estimates of several global properties of the Milky Way, including its current star formation rate (SFR), the stellar mass contained in its disk and bulge+bar components, as well as its total stellar mass. We do so by combining previous measurements from the literature using a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) statistical method that allows us to account for the possibility that any value may be incorrect or have underestimated errors. We show that this method is robust to a wide variety of assumptions about the nature of problems in individual measurements or error estimates. Ultimately, our analysis yields an SFR for the Galaxy of M\star =1.65+/- 0.19 Mo  yr-1, assuming a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF). By combining HB methods with Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate the latest estimates of the Galactocentric radius of the Sun, R0, the exponential scale length of the disk, Ld, and the local surface density of stellar mass, Sigma\star (R0), we show that the mass of the Galactic bulge+bar is M\star B=0.91+/- 0.07× 1010 Mo , the disk mass is M\star D=5.17+/- 1.11× 1010 Mo , and their combination yields a total stellar mass of M\star =6.08+/- 1.14× 1010 Mo  (assuming a Kroupa IMF and an exponential disk profile). This analysis is based upon a new compilation of literature bulge mass estimates, normalized to common assumptions about the stellar IMF and Galactic disk properties, presented herein. We additionally find a bulge-to-total mass ratio for the Milky Way of B/T=0.150-0.019+0.028 and a specific SFR of M\star /M\star =2.71+/- 0.59× 10-11 yr-1.

AB  - The process of swing amplification is discussed as a possible mechanism to account for the spiral structure of galaxies. The mechanism is proposed to occur in a thin infinite disk of stars with a Gaussian spread of radial velocities orbiting in a force field corresponding to the flattest imaginable law of circular motion, with half of the central force field coming from a rigid and fixed spheroidal halo, which is subject to disturbances resulting from weak, transient external quadrupole forces revolving counterclockwise with the same angular speed as the test particles in the outermost circles. The amplification is shown to result from a combination of galactic shear flow, epicyclic shaking and self-gravity, and to be characterized by oscillations with amplitudes about four times larger than kinematic and arms wound more tightly and of greater density than kinematic features. The unstable spiral modes of a Gaussian disk are then examined, and implications of the swing amplification theory for the prevention of violent bar-making instabilities of disks and the lifetimes of the spiral patterns in normal spirals such as M51 and M81 are noted.

AB  - A model based on disk-stability criteria to determine the number of spiral arms of a general disk galaxy with an exponential disk, a bulge and a dark halo described by a Hernquist model is presented. The multifold rotational symmetry of the spiral structure can be evaluated analytically once the structural properties of a galaxy, such as the circular speed curve, and the disk surface brightness, are known. By changing the disk mass, these models are aimed at varying the critical length scale parameter of the disk and lead to a different spiral morphology in agreement with prior models. Previous studies based on the swing amplification and disk stability have been applied to constrain the mass-to-light ratio in disk galaxies. This formalism provides an analytic expression to estimate the number of arms expected by swing amplification making its application straight-forward to large surveys. It can be applied to predict the number of arms in the Milky Way as a function of radius and to constrain the mass-to-light ratio in disk galaxies for which photometric and kinematic measurements are available, like in the DiskMass survey. Hence, the halo contribution to the total mass in the inner parts of disk galaxies can be inferred in light of the ongoing and forthcoming surveys.

AB  - This paper presents a brief, semi-technical comparison of the essential features of the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to statistical inference, with several illustrative examples implemented in Python. The differences between frequentism and Bayesianism fundamentally stem from differing definitions of probability, a philosophical divide which leads to distinct approaches to the solution of statistical problems as well as contrasting ways of asking and answering questions about unknown parameters. After an example-driven discussion of these differences, we briefly compare several leading Python statistical packages which implement frequentist inference using classical methods and Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo.

AB  - Petrosian magnitudes were designed to help with the difficult task of determining a galaxy's total light. Although these magnitudes [taken here as the flux within 2RP, with the inverted Petrosian index 1/eta(RP)=0.2] can represent most of an object's flux, they do of course miss the light outside the Petrosian aperture (2RP). The size of this flux deficit varies monotonically with the shape of a galaxy's light profile, i.e., its concentration. In the case of a de Vaucouleurs R1/4 profile, the deficit is 0.20 mag; for an R1/8 profile this figure rises to 0.50 mag. Here we provide a simple method for recovering total (Sérsic) magnitudes from Petrosian magnitudes using only the galaxy concentration (R90/R50 or R80/R20) within the Petrosian aperture. The corrections hold to the extent that Sérsic's model provides a good description of a galaxy's luminosity profile. We show how the concentration can also be used to convert Petrosian radii into effective half-light radii, enabling a robust measure of the mean effective surface brightness. Our technique is applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2 (SDSS DR2) Petrosian parameters, yielding good agreement with the total magnitudes, effective radii, and mean effective surface brightnesses obtained from the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog Sérsic R1/n fits by Blanton and coworkers. Although the corrective procedure described here is specifically applicable to the SDSS DR2 and DR3, it is generally applicable to all imaging data where any Petrosian index and concentration can be constructed.

AB  - We present our methods for generating a catalogue of 7000 synthetic images and 40 000 integrated spectra of redshift z = 0 galaxies from the Illustris simulation. The mock data products are produced by using stellar population synthesis models to assign spectral energy distributions (SED) to each star particle in the galaxies. The resulting synthetic images and integrated SEDs therefore properly reflect the spatial distribution, stellar metallicity distribution, and star formation history of the galaxies. From the synthetic data products, it is possible to produce monochromatic or colour-composite images, perform SED fitting, classify morphology, determine galaxy structural properties, and evaluate the impacts of galaxy viewing angle. The main contribution of this paper is to describe the production, format, and composition of the image catalogue that makes up the Illustris Simulation Observatory. As a demonstration of this resource, we derive galactic stellar mass estimates by applying the SED fitting code FAST to the synthetic galaxy products, and compare the derived stellar masses against the true stellar masses from the simulation. We find from this idealized experiment that systematic biases exist in the photometrically derived stellar mass values that can be reduced by using a fixed metallicity in conjunction with a minimum galaxy age restriction.

AB  - [abridged] We quantify the morphological evolution of z~0 massive galaxies ($M*/M_\odot\sim10^11$) from z~3 in the 5 CANDELS fields. The progenitors are selected using abundance matching techniques to account for the mass growth. The morphologies strongly evolve from z~3. At z<1, the population matches the massive end of the Hubble sequence, with 30% of spheroids, 50% of galaxies with equally dominant disk and bulge components and 20% of disks. At z~2-3 there is a majority of irregular systems (~60-70%) with still 30% of spheroids. We then analyze the SFRs, gas fractions and structural properties for the different morphologies independently. Our results suggest two distinct channels for the growth of bulges in massive galaxies. Around 30-40% were already bulges at z~2.5, with low average SFRs and gas-fractions (10-15%), high Sersic indices (n>3-4) and small effective radii ($R_e$~1 kpc) pointing towards an early formation through gas-rich mergers or VDI. Between z~ 2.5 and z~0, they rapidly increase their size by a factor of ~4-5, become all passive but their global morphology remains unaltered. The structural evolution is independent of the gas fractions, suggesting that it is driven by ex-situ events. The remaining 60% experience a gradual morphological transformation, from clumpy disks to more regular bulge+disks systems, essentially happening at z>1. It results in the growth of a significant bulge component (n~3) for 2/3 of the systems possibly through the migration of clumps while the remaining 1/3 keeps a rather small bulge (n~1.5-2). The transition phase between disturbed and relaxed systems and the emergence of the bulge is correlated with a decrease of the star formation activity and the gas fractions. The growth of the effective radii scales roughly with $H(z)^-1$ and it is therefore consistent with the expected growth of disks in galaxy haloes.

AB  - We measure the stellar mass-star formation rate (SFR) relation in star-forming disc galaxies at z <= 0.085, using Galaxy Zoo morphologies to examine different populations of spirals as classified by their kiloparsec-scale structure. We examine the number of spiral arms, their relative pitch angle, and the presence of a galactic bar in the disc, and show that both the slope and dispersion of the M*-SFR relation is constant when varying all the above parameters. We also show that mergers (both major and minor), which represent the strongest conditions for increases in star formation at a constant mass, only boost the SFR above the main relation by ˜0.3 dex; this is significantly smaller than the increase seen in merging systems at z > 1. Of the galaxies lying significantly above the M*-SFR relation in the local Universe, more than 50 per cent are mergers. We interpret this as evidence that the spiral arms, which are imperfect reflections of the galaxy's current gravitational potential, are either fully independent of the various quenching mechanisms or are completely overwhelmed by the combination of outflows and feedback. The arrangement of the star formation can be changed, but the system as a whole regulates itself even in the presence of strong dynamical forcing.

AB  - Does galaxy evolution proceed through the green valley via multiple pathways or as a single population? Motivated by recent results highlighting radically different evolutionary pathways between early- and late-type galaxies, we present results from a simple Bayesian approach to this problem wherein we model the star formation history (SFH) of a galaxy with two parameters, [t, tau] and compare the predicted and observed optical and near-ultraviolet colours. We use a novel method to investigate the morphological differences between the most probable SFHs for both disc-like and smooth-like populations of galaxies, by using a sample of 126 316 galaxies (0.01 < z < 0.25) with probabilistic estimates of morphology from Galaxy Zoo. We find a clear difference between the quenching time-scales preferred by smooth- and disc-like galaxies, with three possible routes through the green valley dominated by smooth- (rapid time-scales, attributed to major mergers), intermediate- (intermediate time-scales, attributed to minor mergers and galaxy interactions) and disc-like (slow time-scales, attributed to secular evolution) galaxies. We hypothesize that morphological changes occur in systems which have undergone quenching with an exponential time-scale tau < 1.5 Gyr, in order for the evolution of galaxies in the green valley to match the ratio of smooth to disc galaxies observed in the red sequence. These rapid time-scales are instrumental in the formation of the red sequence at earlier times; however, we find that galaxies currently passing through the green valley typically do so at intermediate time-scales.†

AB  - The formation of bars in disc galaxies is a tracer of the dynamical maturity of the population. Previous studies have found that the incidence of bars in discs decreases from the local Universe to z ˜ 1, and by z > 1 simulations predict that bar features in dynamically mature discs should be extremely rare. Here, we report the discovery of strong barred structures in massive disc galaxies at z ˜ 1.5 in deep rest-frame optical images from the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. From within a sample of 876 disc galaxies identified by visual classification in Galaxy Zoo, we identify 123 barred galaxies. Selecting a subsample within the same region of the evolving galaxy luminosity function (brighter than L*), we find that the bar fraction across the redshift range 0.5 <= z <= 2 ( f_bar = 10.7^+6.3_-3.5 per cent after correcting for incompleteness) does not significantly evolve. We discuss the implications of this discovery in the context of existing simulations and our current understanding of the way disc galaxies have evolved over the last 11 billion years.

AB  - We present narrow- and medium-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging, with additional supporting ground-based imaging, spectrophotometry, and Fabry--Perot interferometric data, for eight galaxies identified as hosting a fading active galactic nucleus (AGN). These are selected to have AGN-ionized gas projected \gt 10 kpc from the nucleus and energy budgets with a significant shortfall of ionizing radiation between the requirement to ionize the distant gas and the AGN as observed directly, indicating fading of the AGN on ≈50,000 yr timescales. This paper focuses on the host-galaxy properties and origin of the gas. In every galaxy, we identify evidence of ongoing or past interactions, including tidal tails, shells, and warped or chaotic dust structures; a similarly selected sample of obscured AGNs with extended ionized clouds shares this high incidence of disturbed morphologies. Several systems show multiple dust lanes in different orientations, broadly fit by differentially precessing disks of accreted material viewed ~1.5 Gyr after its initial arrival. The host systems are of early Hubble type; most show nearly pure de Vaucouleurs surface brightness profiles and Sérsic indices appropriate for classical bulges, with one S0 and one SB0 galaxy. The gas has a systematically lower metallicity than the nuclei; three systems have abundances uniformly well below solar, consistent with an origin in tidally disrupted low-luminosity galaxies, while some systems have more nearly solar abundances (accompanied by such signatures as multiple Doppler components), which may suggest redistribution of gas by outflows within the host galaxies themselves. These aspects are consistent with a tidal origin for the extended gas in most systems, although the ionized gas and stellar tidal features do not always match closely. Unlike extended emission regions around many radio-loud AGNs, these clouds are kinematically dominated by rotation, in some cases in warped disks. Outflows can play important kinematic roles only in localized regions near some of the AGNs. We find only a few sets of young star clusters potentially triggered by AGN outflows. In UGC 7342 and UGC 11185, multiple luminous star clusters are seen just within the projected ionization cones, potentially marking star formation triggered by outflows. As in the discovery example, Hanny's Voorwerp/IC 2497, there are regions in these clouds where the lack of a strong correlation between Halpha surface brightness and ionization parameter indicates that there is unresolved fine structure in the clouds. Together with thin coherent filaments spanning several kpc, persistence of these structures over their orbital lifetimes may require a role for magnetic confinement. Overall, we find that the sample of fading AGNs occur in interacting and merging systems, that the very extended ionized gas is composed of tidal debris rather than galactic winds, and that these host systems are bulge-dominated and show no strong evidence of triggered star formation in luminous clusters.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract No. NAS5-26555.

AB  - We construct a stellar cluster catalog for the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey using image classifications collected from the Andromeda Project citizen science website. We identify 2753 clusters and 2270 background galaxies within ~0.5 deg2 of PHAT imaging searched, or ~400 kpc2 in deprojected area at the distance of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). These identifications result from 1.82 million classifications of ~20,000 individual images (totaling ~7 gigapixels) by tens of thousands of volunteers. We show that our crowd-sourced approach, which collects >80 classifications per image, provides a robust, repeatable method of cluster identification. The high spatial resolution Hubble Space Telescope images resolve individual stars in each cluster and are instrumental in the factor of ~6 increase in the number of clusters known within the survey footprint. We measure integrated photometry in six filter passbands, ranging from the near-UV to the near-IR. PHAT clusters span a range of ~8 magnitudes in F475W (g-band) luminosity, equivalent to ~4 decades in cluster mass. We perform catalog completeness analysis using >3000 synthetic cluster simulations to determine robust detection limits and demonstrate that the catalog is 50% complete down to ~500 Mo  for ages <100 Myr. We include catalogs of clusters, background galaxies, remaining unselected candidates, and synthetic cluster simulations, making all information publicly available to the community. The catalog published here serves as the definitive base data product for PHAT cluster science, providing a census of star clusters in an L\star  spiral galaxy with unmatched sensitivity and quality.

AB  - We study the influence of the presence of a strong bar in disc galaxies which host an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and morphological classifications from the Galaxy Zoo 2 project, we create a volume-limited sample of 19 756 disc galaxies at 0.01 < z < 0.05 which have been visually examined for the presence of a bar. Within this sample, AGN host galaxies have a higher overall percentage of bars (51.8 per cent) than inactive galaxies exhibiting central star formation (37.1 per cent). This difference is primarily due to known effects: that the presence of both AGN and galactic bars is strongly correlated with both the stellar mass and integrated colour of the host galaxy. We control for this effect by examining the difference in AGN fraction between barred and unbarred galaxies in fixed bins of mass and colour. Once this effect is accounted for, there remains a small but statistically significant increase that represents 16 per cent of the average barred AGN fraction. Using the L_[O III]/MBH ratio as a measure of AGN strength, we show that barred AGNs do not exhibit stronger accretion than unbarred AGNs at a fixed mass and colour. The data are consistent with a model in which bar-driven fuelling does contribute to the probability of an actively growing black hole, but in which other dynamical mechanisms must contribute to the direct AGN fuelling via smaller, non-axisymmetric perturbations.

AB  - Measuring the morphological parameters of galaxies is a key requirement for studying their formation and evolution. Surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey have resulted in the availability of very large collections of images, which have permitted population-wide analyses of galaxy morphology. Morphological analysis has traditionally been carried out mostly via visual inspection by trained experts, which is time consuming and does not scale to large (≳104) numbers of images. Although attempts have been made to build automated classification systems, these have not been able to achieve the desired level of accuracy. The Galaxy Zoo project successfully applied a crowdsourcing strategy, inviting online users to classify images by answering a series of questions. Unfortunately, even this approach does not scale well enough to keep up with the increasing availability of galaxy images. We present a deep neural network model for galaxy morphology classification which exploits translational and rotational symmetry. It was developed in the context of the Galaxy Challenge, an international competition to build the best model for morphology classification based on annotated images from the Galaxy Zoo project. For images with high agreement among the Galaxy Zoo participants, our model is able to reproduce their consensus with near-perfect accuracy (>99 per cent) for most questions. Confident model predictions are highly accurate, which makes the model suitable for filtering large collections of images and forwarding challenging images to experts for manual annotation. This approach greatly reduces the experts' workload without affecting accuracy. The application of these algorithms to larger sets of training data will be critical for analysing results from future surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

AB  - We investigate the mid-infrared properties of the largest (42 objects) sample of radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (RL NLS1) collected to date, using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We analyse the mid-IR colours of these objects and compare them to what is expected from different combinations of AGN and galaxy templates. We find that, in general, the host-galaxy emission gives an importan contribution to the observed mid-IR flux in particular at the longest wavelengths (W3, at 12micron, and W4, at 22micron). In about half of the sources (22 objects) we observe a very red mid-IR colour (W4-W3>2.5) that can be explained only using a starburst galaxy template (M82). Using the 22micron luminosities, corrected for the AGN contribution, we have then estimated the star-formation rate for 20 of these "red" RL NLS1, finding values ranging from 10 to 500 Msun/y. For the RL NLS1 showing bluer colours, instead, we cannot exclude the presence of a star-forming host galaxy although, on average, we expect a lower star-formation rate. Studying the radio (1.4GHz) to mid-IR (22micron) flux ratios of the RL NLS1 in the sample we found that in ~10 objects the star-forming activity could represent the most important component also at radio frequencies, in addition (or in alternative) to the relativistic jet. We conclude that both the mid-IR and the radio emission of RL NLS1 are a mixture of different components, including the relativistic jet, the dusty torus and an intense star-forming activity.

AB  - We review the observed morphological, photometric, and kinematic properties of boxy/peanut (B/P) shape bulges. Nearly half of the bulges in the nearby edge-on galaxies have these characteristics, which fraction is similar to the observed bar fraction in Hubble types earlier than Scd. B/P bulges are generally detected in the edge-on view, but it has been recently demonstrated that barlenses, which are lens-like structures embedded in bars, are the more face-on counterparts of the B/P bulges. Multi-component structural decompositions have shown that B/P/barlens structures are likely to account for most of the bulge light, including the early-type disks harboring most of the bulge mass in galaxies. Cool central disks are often embedded in the B/P/barlens bulges. Barred galaxies contain also dynamically hot classical bulges, but it is not yet clear to what extent they are really dynamically distinct structure components, and to what extent stars wrapped into the central regions of the galaxies during the formation and evolution of bars. If most of the bulge mass in the Milky Way mass galaxies in the nearby universe in- deed resides in the B/P-shape bulges, and not in the classical bulges, that idea needs to be integrated into the paradigm of galaxy formation.

The idea is to provide a "taste" of cosmology and some of the interesting topics it covers. The standard cosmological model is presented and I highlight the successes of cosmology over the past decade or so. Keys to the development of the standard cosmological model are observations of the cosmic microwave background and of large-scale structure, which are introduced. Inflation and dark energy and the outlook for the future are also discussed.

AB  - Spiral arms that emerge from the ends of a galactic bar are important in interpreting observations of our and external galaxies. It is therefore important to understand the physical mechanism that causes them. We find that these spiral arms can be understood as kinematic density waves generated by librations around underlying ballistic closed orbits. This is even true in the case of a strong bar, provided the librations are around the appropriate closed orbits and not around the circular orbits that form the basis of the epicycle approximation. An important consequence is that it is a potential's orbital structure that determines whether a bar should be classified as weak or strong, and not crude estimates of the potential's deviation from axisymmetry.

AB  - We use a Cartesian grid to simulate the flow of gas in a barred Galactic potential and investigate the effects of varying the sound speed in the gas and the resolution of the grid. For all sound speeds and resolutions, streamlines closely follow closed orbits at large and small radii. At intermediate radii shocks arise and the streamlines shift between two families of closed orbits. The point at which the shocks appear and the streamlines shift between orbit families depends strongly on sound speed and resolution. For sufficiently large values of these two parameters, the transfer happens at the cusped orbit as hypothesized by Binney et al. over two decades ago. For sufficiently high resolutions, the flow downstream of the shocks becomes unsteady. If this unsteadiness is physical, as appears to be the case, it provides a promising explanation for the asymmetry in the observed distribution of CO.

AB  - Galaxy formation is significantly modulated by energy output from supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies which grow in highly efficient luminous quasar phases. The timescale on which black holes transition into and out of such phases is, however, unknown. We present the first measurement of the shutdown timescale for an individual quasar using X-ray observations of the nearby galaxy IC 2497, which hosted a luminous quasar no more than 70,000 years ago that is still seen as a light echo in "Hanny's Voorwerp," but whose present-day radiative output is lower by at least two, and more likely by over four, orders of magnitude. This extremely rapid shutdown provides new insight into the physics of accretion in supermassive black holes and may signal a transition of the accretion disk to a radiatively inefficient state.

AB  - To understand the processes driving galaxy morphology and star formation, we need a robust method to classify the structural elements of galaxies. Important but rare and subtle features may be missed by traditional spiral, elliptical, irregular or S\'ersic bulge/disc classifications. To overcome this limitation, we use a principal component analysis of non-parametric morphological indicators (concentration, asymmetry, Gini coefficient, $M_20$, multi-mode, intensity and deviation) measured at rest-frame $B$-band (corresponding to HST/WFC3 F125W at 1.4 $< z <$ 2) to trace the natural distribution of massive ($>10^10 M_\odot$) galaxy morphologies. Principal component analysis (PCA) quantifies the correlations between these morphological indicators and determines the relative importance of each. The first three principal components (PCs) capture $\sim$75 per cent of the variance inherent to our sample. We interpret the first principal component (PC) as bulge strength, the second PC as dominated by concentration and the third PC as dominated by asymmetry. Both PC1 and PC2 correlate with the visual appearance of a central bulge and predict galaxy quiescence. We divide the PCA results into 10 groups using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method. Unlike S\'ersic, this classification scheme separates quenched compact galaxies from larger, smooth proto-elliptical systems, and star-forming disc-dominated clumpy galaxies from star-forming bulge-dominated asymmetric galaxies. Distinguishing between these galaxy structural types in a quantitative manner is an important step towards understanding the connections between morphology, galaxy assembly and star-formation.

AB  - We present our determination of the nuclear supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass function for spiral galaxies in the local universe, established from a volume-limited sample consisting of a statistically complete collection of the brightest spiral galaxies in the southern (delta < 0$\,^\circ$) hemisphere. Our SMBH mass function agrees well at the high-mass end with previous values given in the literature. At the low-mass end, inconsistencies exist in previous works that still need to be resolved, but our work is more in line with expectations based on modeling of black hole evolution. This low-mass end of the spectrum is critical to our understanding of the mass function and evolution of black holes since the epoch of maximum quasar activity. The sample is defined by a limiting luminosity (redshift-independent) distance, D L = 25.4 Mpc (z = 0.00572) and a limiting absolute B-band magnitude, \mathfrak M_B = -19.12. These limits define a sample of 140 spiral galaxies, with 128 measurable pitch angles to establish the pitch angle distribution for this sample. This pitch-angle distribution function may be useful in the study of the morphology of late-type galaxies. We then use an established relationship between the logarithmic spiral arm pitch angle and the mass of the central SMBH in a host galaxy in order to estimate the mass of the 128 respective SMBHs in this volume-limited sample. This result effectively gives us the distribution of mass for SMBHs residing in spiral galaxies over a lookback time, t L <= 82.1 h_67.77^-1 Myr and contained within a comoving volume, V C = 3.37 × 104 h_67.77^-3 Mpc3. We estimate that the density of SMBHs residing in spiral galaxies in the local universe is \rho = 5.54_-2.73^+6.55 × 104 h_67.77^3 M &sun; Mpc-3. Thus, our derived cosmological SMBH mass density for spiral galaxies is \Omega _BH = 4.35_-2.15^+5.14 × 10-7 h 67.77. Assuming that black holes grow via baryonic accretion, we predict that 0.0020_-0.0010^+0.0023 h_67.77^3 % of the universal baryonic inventory (OmegaBH/omegab) is confined within nuclear SMBHs at the center of spiral galaxies.

AB  - A sample of 18 286 radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) is presented, constructed by combining the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with the NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory) VLA (Very Large Array) Sky Survey (NVSS) and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimetres (FIRST) survey. Using this sample, the differences between radio galaxies of 'high-excitation' ('quasar-mode'; hereafer HERG) and 'low-excitation' ('radio-mode'; LERG) are investigated. A primary difference between the two radio source classes is the distinct nature of the Eddington-scaled accretion rate on to their central black holes: HERGs typically have accretion rates between one per cent and 10 per cent of their Eddington rate, whereas LERGs predominately accrete at a rate below one per cent Eddington. This is consistent with models whereby the population dichotomy is caused by a switch between radiatively efficient and radiatively inefficient accretion modes at low accretion rates. Local radio luminosity functions are derived separately for the two populations, for the first time, showing that although LERGs dominate at low radio luminosity and HERGs begin to take over at L1.4 GHz˜ 1026 W Hz-1, examples of both classes are found at all radio luminosities. Using the V/Vmax test it is shown that the two populations show differential cosmic evolution at fixed radio luminosity: HERGs evolve strongly at all radio luminosities, while LERGs show weak or no evolution. This suggests that the luminosity dependence of the evolution previously seen in the radio luminosity function is driven, at least in part, by the changing relative contributions of these two populations with luminosity. The host galaxies of the radio sources are also distinct: HERGs are typically of lower stellar mass, with lower black hole masses, bluer colours, lower concentration indices and less pronounced 4000 Å breaks indicating younger stellar populations. Even if samples are matched in radio luminosity and stellar and black hole masses, significant differences still remain between the accretion rates, stellar populations and structural properties of the host galaxies of the two radio source classes. These results offer strong support to the developing picture of radio-loud AGN in which HERGs are fuelled at high rates through radiatively efficient standard accretion discs by cold gas, perhaps brought in through mergers and interactions, while LERGs are fuelled via radiatively inefficient flows at low accretion rates. In this picture, the gas supplying the LERGs is frequently associated with the hot X-ray haloes surrounding massive galaxies, groups and clusters, as part of a radio-AGN feedback loop.

AB  - We report the discovery of a grand-design spiral galaxy associated with a double-lobed radio source. J1649+2635 (z = 0.0545) is a red spiral galaxy with a prominent bulge that it is associated with a L1.4 GHz ˜ 1024 W Hz-1 double-lobed radio source that spans almost 100 kpc. J1649+2635 has a black hole mass of MBH ˜ 3-7 × 108 M&sun; and SFR ˜ 0.26-2.6 M&sun; yr-1. The galaxy hosts an ˜96 kpc diffuse optical halo, which is unprecedented for spiral galaxies. We find that J1649+2635 resides in an overdense environment with a mass of M_dyn = 7.7^+7.9_-4.3 × 10^13 M&sun;, likely a galaxy group below the detection threshold of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. We suggest one possible scenario for the association of double-lobed radio emission from J1649+2635 is that the source may be similar to a Seyfert galaxy, located in a denser-than-normal environment. The study of spiral galaxies that host large-scale radio emission is important because although rare in the local Universe, these sources may be more common at high redshifts.

AB  - We report the discovery of a gravitationally lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxy (L_IR~10^13 L_sun) with strong radio emission (L_1.4GHz~10^25 W/Hz) at z=2.553. The source was identified in the citizen science project SpaceWarps through the visual inspection of tens of thousands of iJKs colour composite images of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), groups and clusters of galaxies and quasars. Appearing as a partial Einstein ring (r_e~3") around an LRG at z=0.2, the galaxy is extremely bright in the sub-millimetre for a cosmological source, with the thermal dust emission approaching 1 Jy at peak. The redshift of the lensed galaxy is determined through the detection of the CO(3-2) molecular emission line with the Large Millimetre Telescope's Redshift Search Receiver and through [OIII] and H-alpha line detections in the near-infrared from Subaru/IRCS. We have resolved the radio emission with high resolution (300-400 mas) eMERLIN L-band and JVLA C-band imaging. These observations are used in combination with the near-infrared imaging to construct a lens model, which indicates a lensing magnification of ~10x. The source reconstruction appears to support a radio morphology comprised of a compact (<250 pc) core and more extended component, perhaps indicative of an active nucleus and jet or lobe.

AB  - The intrinsic properties of the host galaxies of blazars are often unable to be measured due to the high brightness and relativistic beaming of the jet itself. This makes it difficult to determine, for example, whether there is a difference in the parent populations of BL Lacs versus those of flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). As an alternative to direct observation of the host galaxy, we study the Mpc-scale environments using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our study of 757 blazars at 0.05<z<0.75 shows a significant increase in local density over field galaxies. There is no measurable difference, however, between the clustering amplitude of BL Lacs and FSRQs. Similar clustering amplitudes are found for a large sample of powerful radio galaxies. As a result, this data does not rule out a unification model in which BL Lacs and FSRQs are beamed versions of FRI and FRII radio galaxies, respectively. Within the context of the blazar sequence/envelopemodel, our results suggest that the radiative efficiency of accretion, on which the observed properties of jet emission depend, is not affected by the local galactic environment.

AB  - The demographics of the field of Astronomy, and the gender balance in particular, is an important active area of investigation. A piece of information missing from the discussion is the gender breakdown of the applicant pool for faculty positions. For a sample of 35 tenure-track faculty positions at 25 research universities advertised over the last few years in astronomy and astrophysics, I find that the ratio of female applicants to the total number of applicants is ~0.2, with little dispersion and with no strong dependence on the total number of applicants. Some discussion is provided in the context of the fraction of women at the graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, and assistant professor levels, but strong conclusions are not possible given the limitations of the study. Current and future faculty search committees will likely be interested to compare their numbers to this distribution to decide whether or not they could be doing more to attract an applicant pool that is representative of the community.

AB  - We present results from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey on rest-frame optical active galactic nucleus (AGN) identification and completeness at z ~ 2.3. With our sample of 50 galaxies and 10 X-ray and IR-selected AGNs with measured Hbeta, [O III], Halpha, and N II emission lines, we investigate the location of AGNs in the BPT, MEx (mass-excitation), and CEx (color-excitation) diagrams. We find that th BPT diagram works well to identify AGNs at z ~ 2.3 and that the z ~ 0 AGN/star-forming galaxy classifications do not need to shift substantially at z ~ 2.3 to robustly separate these populations. However, the MEx diagram fails to identify all of the AGN identified in the BPT diagram, and the CEx diagram is substantially contaminated at high redshift. We further show that AGN samples selected using the BPT diagram have selection biases in terms of both host stellar mass and stellar population, in that AGNs in low mass and/or high specific star formation rate galaxies are difficult to identify using the BPT diagram. These selection biases become increasingly severe at high redshift, such that optically selected AGN samples at high redshift will necessarily be incomplete. We also find that the gas in the narrow-line region appears to be more enriched than gas in the host galaxy for at least some MOSDEF AGNs. However, AGNs at z ~ 2 are generally less enriched than local AGNs with the same host stellar mass.

AB  - We report ALMA observations of CO(3-2) emission in the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1433 at the unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.''5 = 24 pc. Our aim is to probe active galactic nucleus (AGN) feeding and feedback phenomena through the morphology and dynamics of the gas inside the central kpc. The galaxy NGC 1433 is a strongly barred spiral with three resonant rings: one at the ultra-harmonic resonance near corotation, and the others at the outer and inner Lindblad resonances (OLR and ILR). A nuclear bar of 400 pc radius is embedded in the large-scale primary bar. The CO map, which covers the whole nuclear region (nuclear bar and ring), reveals a nuclear gaseous spiral structure, inside the nuclear ring encircling the nuclear stellar bar. This gaseous spiral is well correlated with the dusty spiral seen in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. The nuclear spiral winds up in a pseudo-ring at ~200 pc radius, which might correspond to the inner ILR. Continuum emission is detected at 0.87 mm only at the very centre, and its origin is more likely thermal dust emission than non-thermal emission from the AGN. It might correspond to the molecular torus expected to exist in this Seyfert 2 galaxy. The HCN(4-3) and HCO+(4-3) lines were observed simultaneously, but only upper limits are derived, with a ratio to the CO(3-2) line lower than 1/60 at 3sigma, indicating a relatively low abundance of very dense gas. The kinematics of the gas over the nuclear disk reveal rather regular rotation only slightly perturbed by streaming motions due to the spiral; the primary and secondary bars are too closely aligned with the galaxy major or minor axis to leave a signature in the projected velocities. Near the nucleus, there is an intense high-velocity CO emission feature redshifted to 200 km s-1 (if located in the plane), with a blue-shifted counterpart, at 2'' (100 pc) from the centre. While the CO spectra are quite narrow in the centre, this wide component is interpreted as an outflow involving a molecular mass of 3.6 × 106 M&sun; and a flow rate ~7 M&sun;/yr. The flow could be in part driven by the central star formation, but is mainly boosted by the AGN through its radio jets.  Based on observations carried out with ALMA in Cycle 0.

AB  - We report ALMA observations of CO(3-2) emission in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 1566, at a spatial resolution of 25 pc. Our aim is to investigate the morphology and dynamics of the gas inside the central kpc, and to probe nuclear fueling and feedback phenomena. NGC 1566 has a nuclear bar of 1.7 kpc radius and a conspicuous grand design spiral starting from this radius. The ALMA field of view, of diameter 0.9 kpc, lies well inside the nuclear bar and reveals a molecular trailing spiral structure from 50 to 300 pc in size, which is contributing to fuel the nucleus, according to its negative gravity torques. The spiral starts with a large pitch angle from the center and then winds up in a pseudo-ring at the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) of the nuclear bar. This is the first time that a trailing spiral structure is clearly seen driving the gas inwards inside the ILR ring of the nuclear bar. This phenomenon shows that the massive central black hole has a significant dynamical influence on the gas, triggering its fueling. The gaseous spiral is well correlated with the dusty spiral seen through extinction in HST images, and also with a spiral feature emitting 0.87 mm continuum. This continuum emission must come essentially from cold dust heated by the interstellar radiation field. The HCN(4-3) and HCO+(4-3) lines were simultaneously mapped and detected in the nuclear spiral. The HCO+(4-3) line is 3 times stronger than the HCN(4-3), as expected when star formation excitation dominates over active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating. The CO(3-2)/HCO+(4-3) integrated intensity ratio is ~100. The molecular gas is in remarkably regular rotation, with only slight non-circular motions at the periphery of the nuclear spiral arms. These perturbations are quite small, and no outflow nor AGN feedback is detected.  Based on observations carried out with ALMA in cycle 0.

AB  - Observations suggest that a large fraction of black hole growth occurs in normal star-forming disc galaxies. Here we describe simulations of black hole accretion in isolated disc galaxies with sufficient resolution (˜5 pc) to track the formation of giant molecular clouds that feed the black hole. Black holes in z ˜ 2 gas-rich discs (fgas ≈ 50 per cent) occasionally undergo ˜10 Myr episodes of Eddington-limited accretion driven by stochastic collisions with massive, dense clouds. We predict that these gas-rich discs host weak AGNs ˜1/4 of the time and moderate/strong AGNs ˜10 per cent of the time. Averaged over ˜100 Myr time-scales and the full distribution of accretion rates, the black holes grow at a few per cent of the Eddington limit - sufficient to match observations and keep the galaxies on the MBH-Mbulge relation. This suggests that dense cloud accretion in isolated z ≈ 2 discs could dominate cosmic black hole growth. In z ˜ 0 discs with fgas ≈ 10 per cent, Eddington-limited growth is extremely rare because typical gas clouds are smaller and more susceptible to disruption by active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. This results in an average black hole growth rate in high-fgas galaxies that is up to 103 times higher than that in low-fgas galaxies. In all our simulations, accretion shows variability by factors of ˜104 on a variety of time-scales, with variability at ˜1 Myr scales driven by the structure of the interstellar medium.

AB  - We present a self-consistent hydrodynamical simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy at a resolution of 0.05 pc. The model includes star formation and a new implementation of stellar feedback through photoionization, radiative pressure and supernovae. The simulation resolves the structure of the interstellar medium at sub-parsec resolution for a few cloud lifetimes and at 0.05 pc for about a cloud-crossing time. The turbulence cascade and gravitation from kpc scales are de facto included in smaller structures like molecular clouds. We show that the formation of a bar influences the dynamics of the central ˜100 pc by creating resonances. At larger radii, the spiral arms host the formation of regularly spaced clouds: beads on a string and spurs. These instabilities pump turbulent energy into the gas, generally in the supersonic regime. Because of asymmetric drift, the supernovae explode outside their gaseous nursery, which diminishes the effect of feedback on the structure of clouds. The evolution of clouds is thus mostly due to fragmentation and gas consumption, regulated mainly by supersonic turbulence. The transition from turbulence-supported to self-gravitating gas is detected in the gas density probability distribution function at ˜2000 cm-3. The power-spectrum density suggests that gravitation governs the hierarchical organization of structures from the galactic scale down to a few pc.

AB  - The third catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by the Fermi-LAT (3LAC) is presented. It is based on the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL) of sources detected with a test statistic (TS) greater than 25, using the first 4 years of data. The 3LAC includes 1591 AGNs located at high Galactic latitudes (|b|>10\deg), which is a 71% increase over the second catalog that was based on 2 years of data. There are 28 duplicate associations (two counterparts to the same gamma-ray source), thus 1563 of the 2192 high-latitude gamma-ray sources of the 3FGL catalog are AGNs. A very large majority of these AGNs (98%) are blazars. About half of the newly detected blazars are of unknown type, i.e., they lack spectroscopic information of sufficient quality to determine the strength of their emission lines. Based on their spectral properties, these sources are evenly split between FSRQs and BL~Lacs. The general properties of the 3LAC sample confirm previous findings from earlier catalogs, but some new subclasses (e.g., intermediate- and high-synchrotron-peaked FSRQs) have now been significantly detected.

AB  - We study how optical galaxy morphology depends on mass and star formation rate (SFR) in the Illustris Simulation. To do so, we measure automated diagnostics of galaxy structure in 10808 simulated galaxies at z=0 with stellar masses 10^9.7 < M_*/M_sun < 10^12.3. We add observational realism to idealized synthetic images and measure non-parametric statistics in rest-frame u, g, i, and H band images from four directions. We find that the Illustris simulation creates a morphologically diverse population of galaxies, occupying roughly the observed bulge strength locus, and reproducing median morphology trends versus stellar mass, SFR, and compactness. Optical morphology correlates realistically with rotational structure, following qualitative classification schemes put forth by kinematic surveys. Relative type fractions as a function of environment agree roughly with data. These results imply that connections among mass, star formation, and galaxy structure arise naturally from models matching global star formation and halo occupation functions when simulated with accurate numerical methods. This raises a question of how to construct the best experiments on large galaxy surveys to better distinguish between models. We predict that at fixed halo mass near 10^12 M_sun, galaxies with relatively more disc-like morphologies have higher stellar mass than those with bulge-like morphologies, a possible consequence of the Illustris feedback model acting on massive galaxies. While Illustris galaxies at M_* ~ 10^11 M_sun have a reasonable size distribution, those at M_* ~ 10^10 M_sun have half-light radii larger than observed by roughly a factor of 2. Furthermore, at M_* ~ 10^10.5 through 10^11 M_sun, a relevant fraction of Illustris galaxies have distinct "ring-like" features, such that the bright pixels have an unusually wide spatial extent (M_20 > -1).

AB  - The increasing importance of digital sky surveys collecting many millions of galaxy images has reinforced the need for robust methods that can perform morphological analysis of large galaxy image databases. Citizen science initiatives such as Galaxy Zoo showed that large data sets of galaxy images can be analyzed effectively by nonscientist volunteers, but since databases generated by robotic telescopes grow much faster than the processing power of any group of citizen scientists, it is clear that computer analysis is required. Here, we propose to use citizen science data for training machine learning systems, and show experimental results demonstrating that machine learning systems can be trained with citizen science data. Our findings show that the performance of machine learning depends on the quality of the data, which can be improved by using samples that have a high degree of agreement between the citizen scientists. The source code of the method is publicly available.

AB  - By combining the data of the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), the Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Akari satellite, we study the infrared colour properties of a sample of 2712 nearby radio-luminous galaxies (RLGs). These RLGs are divided into radio-loud (RL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), mainly occurring at redshifts of $0.05<z<0.3$ and star-forming-dominated RLGs (SFGs), mainly occurring at redshifts of $0.01<z<0.15$. RL AGNs and SFGs are separately distributed in the ([3.4]-[4.6])$-$([4.6]-[12]) two-colour diagram, in which the RL AGNs display a double-core distribution, and the SFGs display a single-core distribution. SFGs have a redder [4.6]-[12] colour than RL AGNs due to the significant contribution from the dust component of SFGs. We find simple criteria of MIR colour separation between RL AGNs and SFGs such that: 95$\$ of RL AGNs have [4.6]-[12] $<$ 3.0 and 94$\$ of SFGs have [4.6]-[12] $>$ 3.0. We also analyse the MIR colours of RL AGNs divided into low- and high-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs and HERGs, respectively). The ([3.4]-[4.6])$-$([4.6]-[12]) diagram clearly shows separate distributions of LERGs and HERGs and a region of overlap, which suggests that LERGs and HERGs have different MIR properties. LERGs are responsible for the double-core distribution of RL AGNs on the ([3.4]-[4.6])$-$([4.6]-[12]) diagram. In addition, we also suggest 90$-$140$\mu$m band spectral index $\alpha(90,140)<-1.4$ as a criterion of selecting nearby active galaxies with non-thermal emissions at FIR wavelengths.

AB  - Human computation is a computing approach that draws upon human cognitive abilities to solve computational tasks for which there are so far no satisfactory fully automated solutions even when using the most advanced computing technologies available. Human computation for citizen science projects consists in designing systems that allow large crowds of volunteers to contribute to scientific research by executing human computation tasks. Examples of successful projects are Galaxy Zoo and FoldIt. A key feature of this kind of project is its capacity to engage volunteers. An important requirement for the proposal and evaluation of new engagement strategies is having a clear understanding of the typical engagement of the volunteers; however, even though several projects of this kind have already been completed, little is known about this issue. In this paper, we investigate the engagement pattern of the volunteers in their interactions in human computation for citizen science projects, how they differ among themselves in terms of engagement, and how those volunteer engagement features should be taken into account for establishing the engagement encouragement strategies that should be brought into play in a given project. To this end, we define four quantitative engagement metrics to measure different aspects of volunteer engagement, and use data mining algorithms to identify the different volunteer profiles in terms of the engagement metrics. Our study is based on data collected from two projects: Galaxy Zoo and The Milky Way Project. The results show that the volunteers in such projects can be grouped into five distinct engagement profiles that we label as follows: hardworking, spasmodic, persistent, lasting, and moderate. The analysis of these profiles provides a deeper understanding of the nature of volunteers' engagement in human computation for citizen science projects

AB  - Pattern recognition techniques have been used with increasing success for coping with the tremendous amounts of data being generated by automated surveys. Usually this process involves construction of training sets, the typical examples of data with known classifications. Given a feature set, along with the training set, statistical methods can be employed to generate a classifier. The classifier is then applied to process the remaining data. Feature set selection, however, is still an issue. This paper presents techniques developed for accommodating data for which a substantive portion of the training set cannot be classified unambiguously, a typical case for low-resolution data. Significance tests on the sort-ordered, sample-size-normalized vote distribution of an ensemble of decision trees is introduced as a method of evaluating relative quality of feature sets. The technique is applied to comparing feature sets for sorting a particular radio galaxy morphology, bent-doubles, from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) database. Also examined are alternative functional forms for feature sets. Associated standard deviations provide the means to evaluate the effect of the number of folds, the number of classifiers per fold, and the sample size on the resulting classifications. The technique also may be applied to situations for which, although accurate classifications are available, the feature set is clearly inadequate, but is desired nonetheless to make the best of available information.

AB  - We present an overview of a new integral field spectroscopic survey called MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory), one of three core programs in the fourth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) that began on 2014 July 1. MaNGA will investigate the internal kinematic structure and composition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearby galaxies. We summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and survey design in the context of MaNGA's key science goals and present prototype observations to demonstrate MaNGA's scientific potential. MaNGA employs dithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary in diameter from 12'' (19 fibers) to 32'' (127 fibers). Two dual-channel spectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 Å at R ~ 2000. With a typical integration time of 3 hr, MaNGA reaches a target r-band signal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (Å-1 per 2'' fiber) at 23 AB mag arcsec-2, which is typical for the outskirts of MaNGA galaxies. Targets are selected with M * >~ 109 M &sun; using SDSS-I redshifts and i-band luminosity to achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, an approximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a wide range of environments. Analysis of our prototype observations demonstrates MaNGA's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formation and quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, and map the composition of stellar populations. MaNGA's spatially resolved spectra will enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies in the coming 6 yr.

AB  - The apparent correlation between the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and total stellar mass (M_star) of galaxies is a fundamental relationship indicating how they formed their stellar populations. To attempt to understand this relation, we hypothesize that the relation and its evolution is regulated by the increase in the stellar and gas mass surface density in galaxies with redshift, which is itself governed by the angular momentum of the accreted gas, the amount of available gas, and by self-regulation of star formation. With our model, we can reproduce the specific SFR-M_star relations at z~1-2 by assuming gas fractions and gas mass surface densities similar to those observed for z=1-2 galaxies. We further argue that it is the increasing angular momentum with cosmic time that causes a decrease in the surface density of accreted gas. The gas mass surface densities in galaxies are controlled by the centrifugal support (i.e., angular momentum), and the sSFR is predicted to increase as, sSFR(z)=(1+z)^3/t_H0, as observed (where t_H0 is the Hubble time and no free parameters are necessary). At z>~2, we argue that star formation is self-regulated by high pressures generated by the intense star formation itself. The star formation intensity must be high enough to either balance the hydrostatic pressure (a rather extreme assumption) or to generate high turbulent pressure in the molecular medium which maintains galaxies near the line of instability (i.e. Toomre Q~1). The most important factor is the increase in stellar and gas mass surface density with redshift, which allows distant galaxies to maintain high levels of sSFR. Without a strong feedback from massive stars, such galaxies would likely reach very high sSFR levels, have high star formation efficiencies, and because strong feedback drives outflows, ultimately have an excess of stellar baryons (abridged).

AB  - Several problems regarding the process of galaxy formation are still open. One of them is the role played by AGN phenomena in contributing to galaxy build-up and to Star Formation (SF) quenching. On the other hand, the theory of AGN formation predicts these phenomena to be correlated with the host-galaxy environment, thus opening for links between SF quenching, environment and AGN phenomena in the galaxy formation paradigm. This work is focused on the study of the correlation between environmental density and radio AGN presence. Using data from the photometric COSMOS survey and the radio 1.4GHz VLA-COSMOS, a sample of radio AGNs has been defined. The environment has been studied throughout the use of the richness distributions inside a parallelepipedon with base side of 1 Mpc and height proportional to the photometric redshift precision. Richness distributions have been compared as a function of both the redshift and the relative evolution of the stellar masses of galaxies and AGN hosts up to $z=2$. Radio AGNs are always located in environments that are significantly denser than those around galaxies in which radio emission is absent. Therefore, the environment seems to enhance the probability of a galaxy to host a radio AGN. Moreover, a distinction between high power and low power radio AGNs leads to the conclusion that the significance in the environmental effect is maintained only for low power radio sources. By studying the evolution of stellar masses it is possible to conclude that radio AGN presence is a phenomenon related to quiescent galaxies up to $z=2$, with a significant increase of the fraction of quiescent galaxies hosting a radio AGN with decreasing redshift. Hints of an environmental effect are present. The results found with this work lead to conclude that denser environments play a significant role in enhancing the probability of a galaxy to host a low power radio AGN.

AB  - We report Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) absorption spectroscopy in four methanol (CH$_3$OH) lines in the $z = 0.88582$ gravitational lens towards PKS1830-211. Three of the four lines have very different sensitivity coefficients $K_\mu$ to changes in the proton-electron mass ratio $\mu$; a comparison between the line redshifts thus allows us to test for temporal evolution in $\mu$. We obtain a stringent statistical constraint on changes in $\mu$ by comparing the redshifted 12.179 GHz and 60.531 GHz lines, $[\Delta mu/\mu] \leq 1.1 \times 10^-7$ ($2\sigma$) over $0 < z \leq 0.88582$, a factor of $\approx 2.5$ more sensitive than the best earlier results. However, the higher signal-to-noise ratio (by a factor of $\approx 2$) of the VLA spectrum in the 12.179 GHz transition also indicates that this line has a different shape from that of the other three CH$_3$OH lines (at $> 4\sigma$ significance). The sensitivity of the above result, and that of all earlier CH$_3$OH studies, is thus likely to be limited by unknown systematic errors, probably arising due to the frequency-dependent structure of PKS1830-211. A robust result is obtained by combining the three lines at similar frequencies, 48.372, 48.377 and 60.531 GHz, whose line profiles are found to be in good agreement. This yields the $2\sigma$ constraint $[\Delta \mu/\mu] \lesssim 4 \times 10^-7$, the most stringent current constraint on changes in $\mu$. We thus find no evidence for changes in the proton-electron mass ratio over a lookback time of $\approx 7.5$ Gyrs.

AB  - Galaxies with stellar masses near M* contain the majority of stellar mass in the universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxy evolution. The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) have present day stellar masses near M*, at 5x10^10 Msol (MW-mass) and 10^11 Msol (M31-mass). We study the typical progenitors of these galaxies using ZFOURGE, a deep medium-band near-IR imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxies out to z~3. We use abundance-matching techniques to identify the main progenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. We measure the evolution in the stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-IR luminosities, and star-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-IR HST imaging from CANDELS, and far-IR imaging from GOODS-H and CANDELS-H. The typical MW-mass and M31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolution stages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages, to redder dust-obscured IR-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and to red, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. The progenitors of the MW-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lower redshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than the progenitors of the M31-mass galaxies. The process driving this evolution, including the suppression of star-formation in present-day M* galaxies requires an evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass threshold for quiescent galaxies. The effective size and star-formation rates imply that the baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift to z~0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the S\'ersic index. Therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in M* galaxies corresponds to a rapid decline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formation efficiency.

AB  - Bent-tailed (BT) radio sources have long been known to trace over densities in the Universe up to z ~ 1 and there is increasing evidence this association persists out to redshifts of 2. The morphology of the jets in BT galaxies is primarily a function of the environment that they have resided in and so BTs provide invaluable clues as to their local conditions. Thus, not only can samples of BT galaxies be used as signposts of large-scale structure, but are also valuable for obtaining a statistical measurement of properties of the intra-cluster medium including the presence of cluster accretion shocks & winds, and as historical anemometers, preserving the dynamical history of their surroundings in their jets. We discuss the use of BTs to unveil large-scale structure and provide an example in which a BT was used to unlock the dynamical history of its host cluster. In addition to their use as density and dynamical indicators, BTs are useful probes of the magnetic field on their environment on scales which are inaccessible to other methods. Here we discuss a novel way in which a particular sub-class of BTs, the so-called `corkscrew' galaxies might further elucidate the coherence lengths of the magnetic fields in their vicinity. Given that BTs are estimated to make up a large population in next generation surveys we posit that the use of jets in this way could provide a unique source of environmental information for clusters and groups up to z = 2.

AB  - The Main Sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies plays a fundamental role in driving galaxy evolution and in our efforts to understand it. However, different studies find significant differences in the normalization, slope and shape of the MS. These discrepancies arise mainly from the different selection criteria adopted to isolate star-forming galaxies, that may include or exclude galaxies with specific star formation rate (SFR) substantially below the MS value. To obviate this limitation of all current criteria, we propose an objective definition of the MS that does not rely at all on a pre-selection of star-forming galaxies. Constructing the 3D SFR-Mass-Number plot, the MS is then defined as the ridge line of the star-forming peak, as illustrated with various figures. The advantages of such definition are manifold. If generally adopted it will facilitate the inter-comparison of results from different groups using the same star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass diagnostics, or to highlight the relative systematics of different diagnostics. All this could help understanding MS galaxies as systems in a quasi-steady state equilibrium and would also provide a more objective criterion for identifying quenching galaxies.

AB  - We present the results of a pilot JVLA project aimed at studying the bulk of the radio-emitting AGN population, unveiled by the NVSS/FIRST and SDSS surveys.We obtained A-array observations at the JVLA at 1.4, 4.5, and 7.5 GHz for 12 sources of the SDSS/NVSS sample. The radio maps reveal compact unresolved or slightly resolved radio structures on a scale of 1-3 kpc, with only one exception of a FRI/FRII source extended over $\sim$40 kpc. We isolate the radio core component in most of them. The sample splits into two groups. Four sources have small black hole (BH) masses (mostly $\sim$10$^7$ M$_\odot$) and are hosted by blue galaxies, often showing evidence of a contamination from star formation to their radio emission and associated with radio-quiet AGN. The second group consists in seven radio-loud AGN, which live in red massive ($\sim10^11$ M$_\odot$) early-type galaxies, with large BH masses ($\gtrsim$10$^8$ M$_\odot$), and spectroscopically classified as Low Excitation Galaxies, all characteristics typical of FRI radio galaxies. They also lie on the correlation between radio core power and [O III] line luminosity defined by FRIs. However, they are more core dominated (by a factor of $\sim$30) than FRIs and show a deficit of extended radio emission. We dub these sources 'FR0' to emphasize their lack of prominent extended radio emission, the single distinguishing feature with respect to FRIs. The differences in radio properties between FR0s and FRIs might be ascribed to an evolutionary effect, with the FR0 sources undergoing to rapid intermittency that prevents the growth of large scale structures. In our preferred scenario the lack of extended radio emission in FR0s is due to their smaller jet Lorentz $\Gamma$ factor with respect to FRIs, causing possible instabilities and their premature disruption.[abridged]

AB  - We develop a method to enable collaborative modelling of gravitational lenses and lens candidates, that could be used by non-professional lens enthusiasts. It uses an existing free-form modelling program (GLASS), but enables the input to this code to be provided in a novel way, via a user-generated diagram that is essentially a sketch of an arrival-time surface. We report on an implementation of this method, SpaghettiLens, which has been tested in a modelling challenge using 29 simulated lenses drawn from a larger set created for the Space Warps citizen science strong lens search. We find that volunteers from this online community asserted the image parities and time ordering consistently in some lenses, but made errors in other lenses depending on the image morphology. While errors in image parity and time ordering lead to large errors in the mass distribution, the enclosed mass was found to be more robust: the model-derived Einstein radii found by the volunteers were consistent with those produced by one of the professional team, suggesting that given the appropriate tools, gravitational lens modelling is a data analysis activity that can be crowd-sourced to good effect. Ideas for improvement are discussed; these include (a) overcoming the tendency of the models to be shallower than the correct answer in test cases, leading to systematic overestimation of the Einstein radius by 10 per cent at present, and (b) detailed modelling of arcs.

AB  - Recent work suggests blue ellipticals form in mergers and migrate quickly from the blue cloud of star-forming galaxies to the red sequence of passively evolving galaxies, perhaps as a result of black hole feedback. Such rapid reddening of stellar populations implies that large gas reservoirs in the pre-merger star-forming pair must be depleted on short time scales. Here we present pilot observations of atomic hydrogen gas in four blue early-type galaxies that reveal increasing spatial offsets between the gas reservoirs and the stellar components of the galaxies, with advancing post-starburst age. Emission line spectra show associated nuclear activity in two of the merged galaxies, and in one case radio lobes aligned with the displaced gas reservoir. These early results suggest that a kinetic process (possibly feedback from black hole activity) is driving the quick truncation of star formation in these systems, rather than a simple exhaustion of gas supply.

AB  - We constrain the slope of the star formation rate (SFR; log Psi) to stellar mass (log M sstarf) relation down to log (M sstarf/M &sun;) = 8.4 (log (M sstarf/M &sun;) = 9.2) at z = 0.5 (z = 2.5) with a mass-complete sample of 39,106 star-forming galaxies selected from the 3D-HST photometric catalogs, using deep photometry in the CANDELS fields. For the first time, we find that the slope is dependent on stellar mass, such that it is steeper at low masses (log Psivproplog M sstarf) than at high masses (log Psivprop(0.3-0.6)log M sstarf). These steeper low-mass slopes are found for three different star formation indicators: the combination of the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR), calibrated from a stacking analysis of Spitzer/MIPS 24 mum imaging; beta-corrected UV SFRs; and Halpha SFRs. The normalization of the sequence evolves differently in distinct mass regimes as well: for galaxies less massive than log (M sstarf/M &sun;) < 10 the specific SFR (Psi/M sstarf) is observed to be roughly self-similar with Psi/M sstarfvprop(1 + z)1.9, whereas more massive galaxies show a stronger evolution with Psi/M sstarfvprop(1 + z)2.2-3.5 for log (M sstarf/M &sun;) = 10.2-11.2. The fact that we find a steep slope of the star formation sequence for the lower mass galaxies will help reconcile theoretical galaxy formation models with the observations.

AB  - The relationship between galaxy star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses ($M_\ast$) is re-examined using a mass-selected sample of $\sim$62,000 star-forming galaxies at $z \le 1.3$ in the COSMOS 2-deg$^2$ field. Using new far-infrared photometry from $Herschel$-PACS and SPIRE and $Spitzer$-MIPS 24 $\mu$m, along with derived infrared luminosities from the NRK method based on galaxies' locations in the restframe color-color diagram $(NUV - r)$ vs. $(r - K)$, we are able to more accurately determine total SFRs for our complete sample. At all redshifts, the relationship between median $SFR$ and $M_\ast$ follows a power-law at low stellar masses, and flattens to nearly constant SFR at high stellar masses. We describe a new parameterization that provides the best fit to the main sequence and characterizes the low mass power-law slope, turnover mass, and overall scaling. The turnover in the main sequence occurs at a characteristic mass of about $M_0 \sim 10^10 M_\odot$ at all redshifts. The low mass power-law slope ranges from 0.9-1.3 and the overall scaling rises in SFR as a function of $(1+z)^4.12 \pm 0.10$. A broken power-law fit below and above the turnover mass gives relationships of $SFR \propto M_*^0.88 \pm 0.06$ below the turnover mass and $SFR \propto M_*^0.27 \pm 0.04$ above the turnover mass. Galaxies more massive than $M_\ast \gtrsim 10^10\ M_\rm \odot$ have on average, a much lower specific star formation rate (sSFR) than would be expected by simply extrapolating the traditional linear fit to the main sequence found for less massive galaxies.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - We use a semi-analytic model for disk galaxies to explore the origin of the time evolution and small scatter of the galaxy SFR sequence - the tight correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (Mstar). The steep decline of SFR from z ~ 2 to the present, at fixed Mstar, is a consequence of the following. First, disk galaxies are in a steady state with the SFR following the net (i.e. inflow minus outflow) gas accretion rate. The evolution of the SFR sequence is determined by evolution in the cosmological specific accretion rates, ~ (1 + z)2.25, but is found to be independent of feedback. Although feedback determines the outflow rates, it shifts galaxies along the SFR sequence, leaving its zero-point invariant. Second, the conversion of accretion rate to SFR is materialized through gas density, not gas mass. Although the model SFR is an increasing function of both gas mass fraction and gas density, only the gas densities are predicted to evolve significantly with redshift. Third, star formation is fueled by molecular gas. Since the molecular gas fraction increases monotonically with increasing gas density, the model predicts strong evolution in the molecular gas fractions, increasing by an order of magnitude from z = 0 to z ~ 2. On the other hand, the model predicts that the effective surface density of atomic gas is , independent of redshift, stellar mass or feedback. Our model suggests that the scatter in the SFR sequence reflects variations in the gas accretion history, and thus is insensitive to stellar mass, redshift or feedback. The large scatter in halo spin contributes negligibly, because it scatters galaxies along the SFR sequence. An observational consequence of this is that the scatter in the SFR sequence is independent of the size (both stellar and gaseous) of galaxy disks.

AB  - Star-formation rates (SFR) of disk galaxies strongly correlate with stellar mass, with a small dispersion in SSFR at fixed mass, sigma~0.3 dex. With such small scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as deterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple consequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by approximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a random walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at the previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of star-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for stochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are correlated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an expectation that <SSFR> should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have a relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and its evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to constrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important observables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation. The evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways to generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as mergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the classification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous formation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their star-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's insensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the ability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic baselines.

AB  - We investigate early black hole (BH) growth through the methodical search for $z\gtrsim5$ AGN in the $Chandra$ Deep Field South. We base our search on the $Chandra$ 4-Ms data with flux limits of $9.1\times\ 10^-18$ (soft, 0.5 - 2 keV) and $5.5\times\ 10^-17\ erg\ s^-1\ cm^-2$ (hard, 2 - 8 keV). At $z\sim5$ this corresponds to luminosities as low as $\sim10^42$ ($\sim10^43$) $erg\ s^-1$ in the soft (hard) band and should allow us to detect Compton-thin AGN with $M_BH>10^7 M_\odot$ and Eddington ratios > 0.1. Our field ($0.03~deg^2$) contains over 600 $z\sim5$ Lyman Break Galaxies. Based on lower redshift relations we would expect $\sim20$ of them to host AGN. After combining the $Chandra$ data with GOODS/ACS, CANDELS/WFC3 and $Spitzer$/IRAC data, the sample consists of 58 high-redshift candidates. We run a photometric redshift code, stack the GOODS/ACS data, apply colour criteria and the Lyman Break Technique and use the X-ray Hardness Ratio. We combine our tests and using additional data find that all sources are most likely at low redshift. We also find five X-ray sources without a counterpart in the optical or infrared which might be spurious detections. We conclude that our field does not contain any convincing $z\gtrsim5$ AGN. Explanations for this result include a low BH occupation fraction, a low AGN fraction, short, super-Eddington growth modes, BH growth through BH-BH mergers or in optically faint galaxies. By searching for $z\gtrsim5$ AGN we are setting the foundation for constraining early BH growth and seed formation scenarios.

AB  - Yellowballs are a collection of approximately 900 compact, infrared sources identified and named by volunteers participating in the Milky Way Project (MWP), a citizen science project that uses GLIMPSE/MIPSGAL images from Spitzer to explore topics related to Galactic star formation. In this paper, through a combination of catalog cross-matching and infrared color analysis, we show that yellowballs are a mix of compact star-forming regions, including ultra-compact and compact H II regions, as well as analogous regions for less massive B-type stars. The resulting MWP yellowball catalog provides a useful complement to the Red MSX Source survey. It similarly highlights regions of massive star formation, but the selection of objects purely on the basis of their infrared morphology and color in Spitzer images identifies a signature of compact star-forming regions shared across a broad range of luminosities and, by inference, masses. We discuss the origin of their striking mid-infrared appearance and suggest that future studies of the yellowball sample will improve our understanding of how massive and intermediate-mass star-forming regions transition from compact to more extended bubble-like structures.

AB  - Context. Luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) are systems enshrouded in dust, which absorbs most of their optical/UV emission and radiates it again in the mid- and far-infrared. Radio observations are largely unaffected by dust obscuration, enabling us to study the central regions of LIRGs in an unbiased manner.  Aims: The main goal of this project is to examine how the radio properties of local LIRGs relate to their infrared spectral characteristics. Here we present an analysis of the radio continuum properties of a subset of the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS), which consists of 202 nearby systems (z< 0.088). Our radio sample consists of 35 systems, containing 46 individual galaxies, that were observed at both 1.49 and 8.44 GHz with the VLA with a resolution of about 1 arcsec (FWHM). The aim of the project is to use the radio imagery to probe the central kpc of these LIRGs in search of active galactic nuclei (AGN).  Methods: We used the archival data at 1.49 and 8.44 GHz to create radio-spectral-index maps using the standard relation between flux density Snu and frequency nu, Snu ~ nu- alpha, where alpha is the radio spectral index. By studying the spatial variations in alpha, we classified the objects as radio-AGN, radio-SB, and AGN/SB (a mixture). We identified the presence of an active nucleus using the radio morphology, deviations from the radio/infrared correlation, and spatially resolved spectral index maps, and then correlated this to the usual mid-infrared ([NeV]/[NeII] and [OIV]/[NeII] line ratios and equivalent width of the 6.2 mum PAH feature) and optical (BPT diagram) AGN diagnostics.  Results: We find that 21 out of the 46 objects in our sample (~45%) are radio-AGN, 9 out of the 46 (~20%) are classified as starbursts (SB) based on the radio analysis, and 16 (~35%) are AGN/SB. After comparing to other AGN diagnostics we find 3 objects out of the 46 (~7%) that are identified as AGN based on the radio analysis, but are not classified as such based on the mid-infrared and optical AGN diagnostics presented in this study.

AB  - ABSTRACT The global tropical cyclone intensity record, even in modern times, is uncertain because the vast majority of storms are only remotely observed. Forecasters determine the maximum wind speed using a patchwork of sporadic observations and remotely sensed data. A popular tool that aids forecasters is the Dvorak technique, a procedural system that estimates the maximum wind based on cloud features in IR and/or Visible satellite imagery. Inherently, the application of the Dvorak procedure is open to subjectivity. Heterogeneities are also introduced into the historical record with the evolution of operational procedures, personnel, and observing platforms. These uncertainties impede our ability to identify the relationship between tropical cyclone intensities and, for example, recent climate change. A global reanalysis of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity using experts is difficult because of the large number of storms. We will show that it is possible to effectively reanalyze the global record using crowdsourcing. Through modifying the Dvorak technique into a series of simple questions that amateurs (?citizen scientists?) can answer on a website, we are working toward developing a new TC dataset that resolves intensity discrepancies in several recent TCs. Preliminary results suggest that the performance of human classifiers in some cases exceeds that of an automated Dvorak technique applied to the same data for times when the storm is transitioning into a hurricane. Capsule The modern global tropical cyclone record is littered with uncertainty; crowdsourcing could help clean up the mess.

AB  - We present Brut, an algorithm to identify bubbles in infrared images of the Galactic midplane. Brut is based on the Random Forest algorithm, and uses bubbles identified by >35,000 citizen scientists from the Milky Way Project to discover the identifying characteristics of bubbles in images from the Spitzer Space Telescope. We demonstrate that Brut's ability to identify bubbles is comparable to expert astronomers. We use Brut to re-assess the bubbles in the Milky Way Project catalog, and find that 10%-30% of the objects in this catalog are non-bubble interlopers. Relative to these interlopers, high-reliability bubbles are more confined to the mid-plane, and display a stronger excess of young stellar objects along and within bubble rims. Furthermore, Brut is able to discover bubbles missed by previous searches---particularly bubbles near bright sources which have low contrast relative to their surroundings. Brut demonstrates the synergies that exist between citizen scientists, professional scientists, and machine learning techniques. In cases where "untrained" citizens can identify patterns that machines cannot detect without training, machine learning algorithms like Brut can use the output of citizen science projects as input training sets, offering tremendous opportunities to speed the pace of scientific discovery. A hybrid model of machine learning combined with crowdsourced training data from citizen scientists can not only classify large quantities of data, but also address the weakness of each approach if deployed alone.

AB  - We report the discovery of 14 new transiting planet candidates in the Kepler field from the Planet Hunters citizen science program. None of these candidates overlapped with Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) at the time of submission. We report the discovery of one more addition to the six planet candidate system around KOI-351, making it the only seven planet candidate system from Kepler. Additionally, KOI-351 bears some resemblance to our own solar system, with the inner five planets ranging from Earth to mini-Neptune radii and the outer planets being gas giants; however, this system is very compact, with all seven planet candidates orbiting <~ 1 AU from their host star. A Hill stability test and an orbital integration of the system shows that the system is stable. Furthermore, we significantly add to the population of long period transiting planets; periods range from 124 to 904 days, eight of them more than one Earth year long. Seven of these 14 candidates reside in their host star's habitable zone.  .

AB  - We report the discovery of one newly confirmed planet (P = 66.06 days, R P = 2.68 $\pm$ 0.17 R ⊕) and mass determinations of two previously validated Kepler planets, Kepler-289 b (P = 34.55 days, R P = 2.15 $\pm$ 0.10 R ⊕) and Kepler-289-c (P = 125.85 days, R P = 11.59 $\pm$ 0.10 R ⊕), through their transit timing variations (TTVs). We also exclude the possibility that these three planets reside in a 1:2:4 Laplace resonance. The outer planet has very deep (~1.3%), high signal-to-noise transits, which puts extremely tight constraints on its host star's stellar properties via Kepler's Third Law. The star PH3 is a young (~1 Gyr as determined by isochrones and gyrochronology), Sun-like star with M * = 1.08 $\pm$ 0.02 M &sun;, R * = 1.00 $\pm$ 0.02 R &sun;, and T eff = 5990 $\pm$ 38 K. The middle planet's large TTV amplitude (~5 hr) resulted either in non-detections or inaccurate detections in previous searches. A strong chopping signal, a shorter period sinusoid in the TTVs, allows us to break the mass-eccentricity degeneracy and uniquely determine the masses of the inner, middle, and outer planets to be M = 7.3 $\pm$ 6.8 M ⊕, 4.0 $\pm$ 0.9M ⊕, and M = 132 $\pm$ 17 M ⊕, which we designate PH3 b, c, and d, respectively. Furthermore, the middle planet, PH3 c, has a relatively low density, rho = 1.2 $\pm$ 0.3 g cm-3 for a planet of its mass, requiring a substantial H/He atmosphere of 2.1+0.8-0.3% by mass, and joins a growing population of low-mass, low-density planets.  .

AB  - Although giant clumps of stars are crucial to galaxy formation and evolution, the most basic demographics of clumps are still uncertain, mainly because the definition of clumps has not been thoroughly discussed. In this paper, we study the basic demographics of clumps in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 0.5<z<3, using our proposed physical definition that UV-bright clumps are discrete star-forming regions that individually contribute more than 8% of the rest-frame UV light of their galaxies. Clumps defined this way are significantly brighter than the HII regions of nearby large spiral galaxies, either individually or blended, when physical spatial resolution and cosmological dimming are considered. Under this definition, we measure the fraction of SFGs that contain at least one off-center clump (Fclumpy) and the contributions of clumps to the rest-frame UV light and star formation rate of SFGs in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields, where our mass-complete sample consists of 3239 galaxies with axial ratio q>0.5. The redshift evolution of Fclumpy changes with the stellar mass (M*) of the galaxies. Low-mass (log(M*/Msun)<9.8) galaxies keep an almost constant Fclumpy of about 60% from z~3.0 to z~0.5. Intermediate-mass and massive galaxies drop their Fclumpy from 55% at z~3.0 to 40% and 15%, respectively, at z~0.5. We find that (1) the trend of disk stabilization predicted by violent disk instability matches the Fclumpy trend of massive galaxies; (2) minor mergers are a viable explanation of the Fclumpy trend of intermediate-mass galaxies at z<1.5, given a realistic observability timescale; and (3) major mergers are unlikely responsible for the Fclumpy trend in all masses at z<1.5. The clump contribution to the rest-frame UV light of SFGs shows a broad peak around galaxies with log(M*/Msun)~10.5 at all redshifts, possibly linked to the molecular gas fraction of the galaxies.

AB  - We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass (M*) and redshift z in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey, for star-forming field galaxies with M*>~1010 Msolar out to z=1.1. The data indicate that the high specific SF rates (SFRs) of many less massive galaxies do not represent late, irregular or recurrent, starbursts in evolved galaxies. They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant SF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on gigayear timescales to z=0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's M*. With decreasing mass, this onset of major SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies (staged galaxy formation). This process may be an important component of the ``downsizing'' phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of SFRs described by Noeske et al. can be reproduced by exponential SF histories (tau models), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer e-folding times tau, and a later onset of SF (zf). Our model can provide a first parameterization of SFR as a function of M* and z, and quantify mass dependences of tau and zf, from direct observations of M* and SFRs up to z>1. The observed evolution of SF in galaxies can plausibly reflect the dominance of gradual gas exhaustion. The data are also consistent with the history of cosmological accretion onto dark matter halos.

AB  - We present a new study investigating whether active galactic nuclei (AGN) beyond the local universe are preferentially fed via large-scale bars. Our investigation combines data from Chandra and Galaxy Zoo: Hubble (GZH) in the AEGIS (All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey), COSMOS (Cosmological Evolution Survey), and (Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-South) GOODS-S surveys to create samples of face-on, disc galaxies at 0.2 < z < 1.0. We use a novel method to robustly compare a sample of 120 AGN host galaxies, defined to have 1042 erg s−1 < LX < 1044 erg s−1, with inactive control galaxies matched in stellar mass, rest-frame colour, size, Sérsic index, and redshift. Using the GZH bar classifications of each sample, we demonstrate that AGN hosts show no statistically significant enhancement in bar fraction or average bar likelihood compared to closely-matched inactive galaxies. In detail, we find that the AGN bar fraction cannot be enhanced above the control bar fraction by more than a factor of 2, at 99.7 per cent confidence. We similarly find no significant difference in the AGN fraction among barred and non-barred galaxies. Thus we find no compelling evidence that large-scale bars directly fuel AGN at 0.2 < z < 1.0. This result, coupled with previous results at z = 0, implies that moderate-luminosity AGN have not been preferentially fed by large-scale bars since z = 1. Furthermore, given the low bar fractions at z > 1, our findings suggest that large-scale bars have likely never directly been a dominant fuelling mechanism for supermassive black hole growth.

AB  - We discuss the construction of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) 10h region (G10) using publicly available data in the Cosmic Evolution Survey region (COSMOS) in order to extend the GAMA survey to z~1 in a single ~1 deg^2 field. In order to obtain the maximum number of high precision spectroscopic redshifts we re-reduce all archival zCOSMOS-bright data and use the GAMA automatic cross-correlation redshift fitting code autoz. We use all available redshift information (autoz, zCOSMOS-bright 10k, PRIMUS, VVDS, SDSS and photometric redshifts) to calculate robust best-fit redshifts for all galaxies and visually inspect all 1D and 2D spectra to obtain 16,583 robust redshifts in the full COSMOS region. We then define the G10 region to be the central ~1deg^2 of COSMOS, which has relatively high spectroscopic completeness, and encompasses the CHILES VLA region. We define a combined r < 23.0mag & i < 22.0mag G10 sample (selected to have the highest bijective overlap) with which to perform future analysis, containing 9,861 sources with reliable high precision VLT-VIMOS spectra. All tables, spectra and imaging are available at: http://ict.icrar.org/cutout/G10 .

AB  - The 3D-HST and CANDELS programs have provided WFC3 and ACS spectroscopy and photometry over ≈900 arcmin2 in five fields: AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-North, GOODS-South, and the UKIDSS UDS field. All these fields have a wealth of publicly available imaging data sets in addition to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength range. In this paper we describe a photometric analysis of the CANDELS and 3D-HST HST imaging and the ancillary imaging data at wavelengths 0.3-8 mum. Objects were selected in the WFC3 near-IR bands, and their SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point-spread function in each observation into account. A total of 147 distinct imaging data sets were used in the analysis. The photometry is made available in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a master catalog containing all objects in the entire survey. We also provide derived data products: photometric redshifts, determined with the EAZY code, and stellar population parameters determined with the FAST code. We make all the imaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductions of the WFC3 imaging in all five fields. 3D-HST is a spectroscopic survey with the WFC3 and ACS grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitute a necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data. All the data presented in this paper are available through the 3D-HST Web site (http://3dhst.research.yale.edu).

AB  - We present deep optical 18-medium-band photometry from the Subaru telescope over the ~30' × 30' Extended Chandra Deep Field-South, as part of the Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC). This field has a wealth of ground- and space-based ancillary data, and contains the GOODS-South field and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. We combine the Subaru imaging with existing UBVRIzJHK and Spitzer IRAC images to create a uniform catalog. Detecting sources in the MUSYC "BVR" image we find ~40,000 galaxies with R AB < 25.3, the median 5sigma limit of the 18 medium bands. Photometric redshifts are determined using the EAzY code and compared to ~2000 spectroscopic redshifts in this field. The medium-band filters provide very accurate redshifts for the (bright) subset of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, particularly at 0.1 < z < 1.2 and at z >~ 3.5. For 0.1 < z < 1.2, we find a 1sigma scatter in Deltaz/(1 + z) of 0.007, similar to results obtained with a similar filter set in the COSMOS field. As a demonstration of the data quality, we show that the red sequence and blue cloud can be cleanly identified in rest-frame color-magnitude diagrams at 0.1 < z < 1.2. We find that ~20% of the red sequence galaxies show evidence of dust emission at longer rest-frame wavelengths. The reduced images, photometric catalog, and photometric redshifts are provided through the public MUSYC Web site.  Based (in part) on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.

AB  - Recent observations with the Murchison Widefield Array at 185~MHz have serendipitously unveiled a heretofore unknown giant and relatively nearby ($z = 0.0178$) radio galaxy associated with NGC\,1534. The diffuse emission presented here is the first indication that NGC\,1534 is one of a rare class of objects (along with NGC\,5128 and NGC\,612) in which a galaxy with a prominent dust lane hosts radio emission on scales of $\sim$700\,kpc. We present details of the radio emission along with a detailed comparison with other radio galaxies with disks. NGC1534 is the lowest surface brightness radio galaxy known with an estimated scaled 1.4-GHz surface brightness of just 0.2\,mJy\,arcmin$^-2$. The radio lobes have one of the steepest spectral indices yet observed: $\alpha=-2.1\pm0.1$, and the core to lobe luminosity ratio is $<0.1$\. We estimate the space density of this low brightness (dying) phase of radio galaxy evolution as $7\times10^-7$\,Mpc$^-3$ and argue that normal AGN cannot spend more than 6\ of their lifetime in this phase if they all go through the same cycle.

AB  - We present and release co-added images of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82. Stripe 82 covers an area of ~300 deg2 on the celestial equator, and has been repeatedly scanned 70-90 times in the ugriz bands by the SDSS imaging survey. By making use of all available data in the SDSS archive, our co-added images are optimized for depth. Input single-epoch frames were properly processed and weighted based on seeing, sky transparency, and background noise before co-addition. The resultant products are co-added science images and their associated weight images that record relative weights at individual pixels. The depths of the co-adds, measured as the 5sigma detection limits of the aperture (3.''2 diameter) magnitudes for point sources, are roughly 23.9, 25.1, 24.6, 24.1, and 22.8 AB magnitudes in the five bands, respectively. They are 1.9-2.2 mag deeper than the best SDSS single-epoch data. The co-added images have good image quality, with an average point-spread function FWHM of ~1'' in the r, i, and z bands. We also release object catalogs that were made with SExtractor. These co-added products have many potential uses for studies of galaxies, quasars, and Galactic structure. We further present and release near-IR J-band images that cover ~90 deg2 of Stripe 82. These images were obtained using the NEWFIRM camera on the NOAO 4 m Mayall telescope, and have a depth of about 20.0-20.5 Vega magnitudes (also 5sigma detection limits for point sources).

AB  - We present the first very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) detections of Zeeman splitting in another galaxy. We used Arecibo Observatory, the Green Bank Telescope, and the Very Long Baseline Array to perform dual-polarization observations of OH maser lines in the merging galaxy Arp 220. We measured magnetic fields of $\sim$1-5 mG associated with three roughly parsec-sized clouds in the nuclear regions of Arp 220. Our measured magnetic fields have comparable strengths and the same direction as features at the same velocity identified in previous Zeeman observations with Arecibo alone. The agreement between single dish and VLBI results provides critical validation of previous Zeeman splitting observations of OH megamasers that used a single large dish. The measured magnetic field strengths indicate that magnetic energy densities are comparable to gravitational energy in OH maser clouds. We also compare our total intensity results to previously published VLBI observations of OH megamasers in Arp 220. We find evidence for changes in both structure and amplitude of the OH maser lines that are most easily explained by variability intrinsic to the masing region, rather than variability produced by interstellar scintillation. Our results demonstrate the potential for using high-sensitivity VLBI to study magnetic fields on small spatial scales in extragalactic systems.

AB  - We used Arecibo Observatory and the Green Bank Telescope to observe OH in twelve early-type galaxies with known reservoirs of dense gas. We present three new detections of OH in absorption in the 1667 MHz line. One objective of our survey was to find evidence of molecular outflows, but our sensitivity, and the strength of the OH absorption, were insufficient to detect outflows. The detected sources have infrared luminosities and dust temperatures among the lowest of any galaxy detected in OH absorption. The ratio $L_\rm HCN / L_\rm CO$, a measure of the dense gas fraction in galaxies, is a powerful selector of OH megamasers for galaxies with high infrared luminosity. In early-type galaxies, which have much lower infrared luminosities, $L_\rm HCN / L_\rm CO$ is also a promising tool for discovering OH, but in absorption rather than in maser emission. In addition to dense molecular gas, a radio continuum source and a favorable line-of-sight to the observer are likely key factors in detecting OH absorbers.

AB  - Understanding the evolution of accretion activity is fundamental to our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve over the history of the Universe. We analyse a complete sample of 27 radio galaxies which includes both high-excitation (HEGs) and low excitation galaxies (LEGs), spanning a narrow redshift range of 0.9 < z < 1.1 and covering a factor of ~1000 in radio luminosity. Using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope combined with ground-based optical and near-infrared imaging, we show that the host galaxies have masses in the range of 10.7 < log (M /M_sun) < 12.0 with HEGs and LEGs exhibiting no difference in their mass distributions. We also find that HEGs accrete at significantly higher rates than LEGs, with the HEG/LEG division lying at an Eddington ratio of ~0.04, which is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of where the accretion rate becomes radiatively inefficient, thus supporting the idea of HEGs and LEGs being powered by different modes of accretion. Our study also shows that at least up to L_151MHz ~3x10^27 W /Hz /sr, HEGs and LEGs are indistinguishable in terms of their radio properties. From this result we infer that, at least for the lower radio luminosity range, another factor besides accretion rate must play an important role in the process of triggering jet activity.

AB  - Boxy edge-on profiles can be accounted for not only in models of barred galaxies, but also in models of normal (non-barred) galaxies. Thus the presence of a bar is not a sine qua non condition for the appearance of this feature, as often assumed. We show that a `boxy' or a `peanut' structure in the central parts of a model is due to the presence of vertical resonances at which stable families of periodic orbits bifurcate from the planar x1 family. The orbits of these families reach in their projections on the equatorial plane a maximum distance from the centre, beyond which they increase their mean radii by increasing only their deviations from the equatorial plane. The resulting orbital profiles are `stair-type' and constitute the backbone for the observed boxy structures in edge-on views of N-body models and, we believe, in edge-on views of disc galaxies. Since the existence of vertical resonances is independent of barred or spiral perturbations in the disc, `boxy' profiles may appear also in almost axisymmetric cases.

AB  - We present an atlas of 129 spectral energy distributions for nearby galaxies, with wavelength coverage spanning from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared. Our atlas spans a broad range of galaxy types, including ellipticals, spirals, merging galaxies, blue compact dwarfs, and luminous infrared galaxies. We have combined ground-based optical drift-scan spectrophotometry with infrared spectroscopy from Spitzer and Akari with gaps in spectral coverage being filled using Multi-wavelength Analysis of Galaxy Physical Properties spectral energy distribution models. The spectroscopy and models were normalized, constrained, and verified with matched-aperture photometry measured from Swift, Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Two Micron All Sky Survey, Spitzer, and Wide-field Infrared Space Explorer images. The availability of 26 photometric bands allowed us to identify and mitigate systematic errors present in the data. Comparison of our spectral energy distributions with other template libraries and the observed colors of galaxies indicates that we have smaller systematic errors than existing atlases, while spanning a broader range of galaxy types. Relative to the prior literature, our atlas will provide improved K-corrections, photometric redshifts, and star-formation rate calibrations.

AB  - We have measured the radio continuum emission of 396 early-type galaxies brighter than K = 9, using 1.4 GHz imagery from the NRAO Very Large Array Sky Survey, Green Bank 300 ft Telescope, and 64 m Parkes Radio Telescope. For MK < -24 early-type galaxies, the distribution of radio powers at fixed absolute magnitude spans four orders of magnitude and the median radio power is proportional to K-band luminosity to the power 2.78 $\pm$ 0.16. The measured flux densities of MK < -25.5 early-type galaxies are greater than zero in all cases. It is thus highly likely that the most massive galaxies always host an active galactic nucleus or have recently undergone star formation.

AB  - We have constructed a sample of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars from the Faint Images Radio Sky at Twenty-one centimetres and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, over the Herschel-ATLAS Phase 1 area (9h, 12h and 14h.5). Using a stacking analysis, we find a significant correlation between the far-infrared (FIR) luminosity and 1.4-GHz luminosity for radio-loud quasars. Partial correlation analysis confirms the intrinsic correlation after removing the redshift contribution, while for radio-quiet quasars, no partial correlation is found. Using a single-temperature grey-body model, we find a general trend of lower dust temperatures in case of radio-loud quasars compared to radio-quiet quasars. Also, radio-loud quasars are found to have almost constant mean values of dust mass along redshift and optical luminosity bins. In addition, we find that radio-loud quasars at lower optical luminosities tend to have on average higher FIR and 250-mum luminosity with respect to radio-quiet quasars with the same optical luminosites. Even if we use a two-temperature grey-body model to describe the FIR data, the FIR luminosity excess remains at lower optical luminosities. These results suggest that powerful radio jets are associated with star formation especially at lower accretion rates.

Our analysis of the HDF-N data has produced maps that are significantly deeper than those previously published, and we have used these to search for counterparts to submillimetre sources. For each of the fields, we have derived normalized differential source counts and in the case of the HDF-N find no evidence for the previously reported underdensity of sources; our counts are entirely consistent with those found for the majority of other fields.

AB  - Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic ``dark ages'' to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ˜1% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.

AB  - We discuss the possibility of using OH and H2O gigamasers to trace the redshift distribution of luminous, dust-obscured, star-forming galaxies. It has long been thought that ultraluminous, interacting galaxies should host gigamasers, owing to their vast pumping infrared (IR) luminosity, the large column density of molecules available to populate the maser states and the turbulent motion of the gas in these dynamically complex systems, which allows unsaturated maser emission. OH masers may thus be well suited to the redshift-blind detection of ultraluminous and hyperluminous infrared galaxies (LFIR>=1012Lsolar) such as those uncovered by the SCUBA submillimetre camera. The bandwidth requirement is low, <1GHz for z=1-10 (lower still if additional redshift constraints are available) and the dual-line 1665-/1667-MHz OH spectral signature can act as a check on the reality of detections.

AB  - We present a series of high-resolution cosmological simulations1 of galaxy formation to z = 0, spanning halo masses ˜108-1013 M&sun;, and stellar masses ˜104-1011 M&sun;. Our simulations include fully explicit treatment of the multiphase interstellar medium and stellar feedback. The stellar feedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directly from stellar population models. These sources of feedback, with zero adjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halo mass up to Mhalo ˜ 1012 M&sun;. We predict weak redshift evolution in the M*-Mhalo relation, consistent with current constraints to z > 6. We find that the M*-Mhalo relation is insensitive to numerical details, but is sensitive to feedback physics. Simulations with only supernova feedback fail to reproduce observed stellar masses, particularly in dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photoheating and radiation pressure) is necessary to destroy giant molecular clouds and enable efficient coupling of later supernovae to the gas. Star formation rates (SFRs) agree well with the observed Kennicutt relation at all redshifts. The galaxy-averaged Kennicutt relation is very different from the numerically imposed law for converting gas into stars, and is determined by self-regulation via stellar feedback. Feedback reduces SFRs and produces reservoirs of gas that lead to rising late-time star formation histories, significantly different from halo accretion histories. Feedback also produces large short-time-scale variability in galactic SFRs, especially in dwarfs. These properties are not captured by common `sub-grid' wind models.

AB  - According to the current paradigm, galaxies initially form as disc galaxies at the centres of their own dark matter haloes. During their subsequent evolution, they may undergo a transformation to a red, early-type galaxy, thus giving rise to the build-up of the red sequence. Two important, outstanding questions are (i) which transformation mechanisms are most important and (ii) in what environment do they occur. In this paper, we study the impact of transformation mechanisms that operate only on satellite galaxies, such as strangulation, ram-pressure stripping and galaxy harassment. Using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we compare the colours and concentrations of satellites galaxies to those of central galaxies of the same stellar mass, adopting the hypothesis that the latter are the progenitors of the former. On average, satellite galaxies are redder and more concentrated than central galaxies of the same stellar mass, indicating that satellite-specific transformation processes do indeed operate. Central-satellite pairs that are matched in both stellar mass and colour, however, show no average concentration difference, indicating that the transformation mechanisms operating on satellites affect colour more than morphology. We also find that the colour and concentration differences of matched central-satellite pairs are completely independent of the mass of the host halo (not to be confused with the subhalo) of the satellite galaxy, indicating that satellite-specific transformation mechanisms are equally efficient in host haloes of all masses. This strongly rules against mechanisms that are thought to operate only in very massive haloes, such as ram-pressure stripping or harassment. Instead, we argue that strangulation is the main transformation mechanism for satellite galaxies. Finally, we determine the relative importance of satellite quenching for the build-up of the red sequence. We find that roughly 70 per cent of red-sequence satellite galaxies with M* ~ 109h-2Msolar had their star formation quenched as satellites. This drops rapidly with increasing stellar mass, reaching virtually zero at M* ~ 1011h-2Msolar. Therefore, a very significant fraction of red satellite galaxies were already quenched before they became a satellite.

AB  - We use the UV-optical color magnitude diagram in combination with spectroscopic and photometric measurements derived from the SDSS spectroscopic sample to measure the distribution of galaxies in the local universe (z<0.25) and their physical properties as a function of specific star formation rate (SFR/M*) and stellar mass (M*). Throughout this study our emphasis is on the properties of galaxies on and off of a local ``star-forming sequence.'' We discuss how the physical characteristics of galaxies along this sequence are related to scaling relations typically derived for galaxies of different morphological types. We find, among other trends, that our measure of the star formation rate surface density, SigmaSFR, is nearly constant along this sequence. We discuss this result and implications for galaxies at higher redshift. For the first time, we report on measurements of the local UV luminosity function versus galaxy structural parameters, as well as inclination. We also split our sample into disk-dominated and bulge-dominated subsamples using the i-band Sersic index and find that disk-dominated galaxies occupy a very tight locus in SFR/M* vs. M* space, while bulge-dominated galaxies display a much larger spread of SFR/M* at fixed stellar mass. A significant fraction of galaxies with SFR/M* and SigmaSFR above those on the ``star-forming sequence'' are bulge-dominated. We can use our derived distribution functions to ask whether a significant fraction of these galaxies may be experiencing a final episode of star formation (possibly induced by a merger or other burst), soon to be quenched, by determining whether this population can explain the growth rate of the non-star-forming galaxies on the ``red sequence.'' We find that this is a plausible scenario for bulge-dominated galaxies near the characteristic transition mass under reasonable assumptions regarding quenching timescales. Similarly, we use this technique to estimate the rate of mergers/starbursts that take galaxies off of the star-forming sequence and show that the implied merger rates are consistent with local measurements.

AB  - The shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed "quenching." Quenching may occur through a variety of processes, e.g., active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, stellar feedback, or the shock heating of gas in the dark matter halo. However, which mechanism(s) is, in fact, responsible for quenching is still in question. This paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenching processes through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass (M *), M */r e, surface stellar mass density (~M */r 2 e), and Sérsic index (n). We analyze the rest-frame U - B color correlations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies in the redshift range 0.5 <= z < 0.8 from the DEEP2/AEGIS survey. In addition to global radii, stellar masses, and Sérsic parameters, we also use "bulge" and "disk" photometric measurements from GIM2D fits to HST/ACS V and I images. We assess the tightness of the color relationships by measuring their "overlap regions," defined as the area in color-parameter space in which red and blue galaxies overlap; the parameter that minimizes these overlap regions is considered to be the most effective color discriminator. We find that Sérsic index (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters and resembles a step function with a threshold value of n = 2.3. There exists, however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high n values that seem to contradict this behavior; they make up ≈40% of n > 2.3 galaxies. We hypothesize that their Sérsic values may be distorted by bursts of star formation, AGNs, and/or poor fits, leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density, Sigma*1 kpc, as an alternative to Sérsic index. Not only does Sigma*1 kpc correct the outliers, but it also forms a tight relationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies is most physically linked with quenching. Furthermore, at z ~ 0.65, the majority of the blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since their GIM2D bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses of similar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass must absolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. We discuss a two-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates are controlled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and a second quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellar mass buildup. The mass buildup is naturally explained by any non-axisymmetric features in the potential, such as those induced by mergers and/or disk instabilities. However, the identity of the second quenching agent is still unknown. We have placed our data catalog online.

AB  - A comparison of B - V colors, blue and far-IR surface brightnesses, metallicities, and star formation rates calculated from H-alpha and UV fluxes reveals no difference in the average star formation rates for galaxies with and without grand design spiral structure. This implies that strong density waves do not trigger a significant excess of star formation compared to that in similar galaxies without a wave. Density waves organize the gas and young stars into spiral arms because of the flow pattern, and they may influence the formation and destruction of the largest cloud complexes, but they appear to contribute less than 50 percent to the overall star formation rate.

AB  - We have measured the radial light profiles and global shapes of bars using two-dimensional 3.6 $\mu m $ image decompositions for 144 face-on barred galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G). The bar surface brightness profile is correlated with the stellar mass and bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio of their host galaxies. Bars in massive and bulge-dominated galaxies (B/T$>$0.2) show a flat profile, while bars in less massive, disk-dominated galaxies (B/T$\sim$0) show an exponential, disk-like profile with a wider spread in the radial profile than in the bulge-dominated galaxies. The global two-dimensional shapes of bars, however, are rectangular/boxy, independent of the bulge or disk properties. We speculate that because bars are formed out of disk, bars initially have an exponential (disk-like) profile which evolves over time, trapping more stars into the boxy bar orbits. This leads bars to become stronger and have flatter profiles. The narrow spread of bar radial profiles in more massive disks suggests that these bars formed earlier (z$>$1), while the disk-like profiles and a larger spread in the radial profile in less massive systems imply a later and more gradual evolution, consistent with the cosmological evolution of bars inferred from observational studies. Therefore, we expect that the flatness of the bar profile can be used as a dynamical age indicator of the bar to measure the time elapsed since the bar formation. We argue that cosmic gas accretion is required to explain our results on bar profile and the presence of gas within the bar region.

AB  - This is the first of two papers describing the second data release (DR2) of the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey at 1.4 GHz, which comprises deep wide-field observations in total intensity, linear polarization, and circular polarization over the Chandra Deep Field-South and European Large Area Infrared Space Observatory Survey-South 1 regions. DR2 improves upon the first data release by maintaining consistent data reductions across the two regions, including polarization analysis, and including differential number counts in total intensity and linear polarization. Typical DR2 sensitivities across the mosaicked multipointing images are 30 muJy beam-1 at approximately 12 arcsec × 6 arcsec resolution over a combined area of 6.4 deg2. In this paper we present detailed descriptions of our data reduction and analysis procedures, including corrections for instrumental effects such as positional variations in image sensitivity, bandwidth smearing with a non-circular beam, and polarization leakage, and application of the BLOBCAT source extractor. We present the DR2 images and catalogues of components (discrete regions of radio emission) and sources (groups of physically associated radio components). We describe new analytic methods to account for resolution bias and Eddington bias when constructing differential number counts of radio components.

AB  - We employ an improved methodology to insert live stellar disks into high-resolution dark matter simulations of Milky Way sized halos, allowing us to investigate the fate of thin stellar disks in the tumultuous environment of cold dark matter structures. We study a set of eight different halos, drawn from the Aquarius simulation project, in which stellar disks are adiabatically grown with a prescribed structure, and then allowed to self-consistently evolve. The initial velocity distribution is set-up in very good equilibrium with the help of the GALIC code. We find that the residual triaxiality of the halos leads to significant disk tumbling, qualitatively confirming earlier work. We show that the disk turning motion is unaffected by structural properties of the galaxies such as the presence or absence of a bulge or bar. In typical Milky Way sized dark matter halos, we expect an average turning of the disks by about 40 degrees between z=1 and z=0, over the coarse of 6 Gyr. We also investigate the impact of the disks on substructures, and conversely, the disk heating rate caused by the dark matter halo substructures. The presence of disks reduces the central subhalo abundance by a about a factor of two, due to an increased evaporation rate by gravitational shocks from disk passages. We find that substructures are important for heating the outer parts of stellar disks but do not appear to significantly affect their inner parts.

AB  - We explore the connections between the evolving galaxy and AGN populations. We present a simple phenomenological model that links the evolving galaxy mass function and the evolving quasar luminosity function, motivated by similarities between the two, which makes specific and testable predictions for the distribution of host galaxy masses for AGN of different luminosities. We show that the phi$^*$ normalisations of the galaxy mass function and the AGN luminosity function closely track each other over a wide range of redshifts, implying a constant "duty cycle" of AGN activity. The strong redshift evolution in the AGN break luminosity $L^*$ is produced by either an evolution in the distribution of Eddington rations, or in the $m_bh/m_*$ mass ratio, or both. An evolving $m_bh/m_*$ ratio, such that it is ten times higher at $z \sim 2$ (i.e. roughly following $(1+z)^2$), reproduces the observed distribution of SDSS quasars in the ($m_bh,L$) plane and accounts for the apparent "sub-Eddington boundary" without new physics and also satisfactorily reproduces the local relations which connect the black hole population with the host galaxies for both quenched and star-forming galaxies. The model produces the appearance of "downsizing" without any mass-dependence in the evolution of black hole growth rates (Eddington ratios) and enables a quantitative assessment of the strong biasses present in luminosity-selected AGN samples. The constant duty cycle is only consistent with the idea that AGN trigger the quenching of star-formation in galaxies if the lifetime of the AGN phase satisfies a particular mass and redshift dependence.

AB  - We explore the processes that trigger local AGN and the role of these AGN in regulating star formation, using ~350 nearby galaxies observed by the mJy Imaging VLBA Exploration at 20cm (mJIVE) survey. The >10^7 K brightness temperature required for an mJIVE detection cannot be achieved via star formation alone, allowing us to unambiguously detect nearby radio AGN and study their role in galaxy evolution. Radio AGN are an order of magnitude more common in early-type galaxies (ETGs) than in their late-type counterparts. The VLBI-detected ETGs in this study have a similar stellar mass distribution to their undetected counterparts, are typically not the central galaxies of clusters and exhibit merger fractions that are significantly higher than in the average ETG. This suggests that these radio AGN (which have VLBI luminosities >10^22 W Hz^-1) are primarily fuelled by mergers, and not by internal stellar mass loss or cooling flows. Our radio AGN are a factor of ~3 times more likely to reside in the UV-optical red sequence than the average ETG. Furthermore, typical AGN lifetimes (a few 10^7 yr) are much shorter than the transit times from blue cloud to red sequence (~1.5 Gyr). This indicates that the AGN are not triggered promptly and appear several dynamical timescales into the associated star formation episode, implying that they typically couple only to residual gas, at a point where star formation has already declined significantly. While evidence for AGN feedback is strong in systems where the black hole is fed by the cooling of hot gas, AGN triggered by mergers appear not to strongly regulate the associated star formation. The inability of the AGN to rapidly quench merger-driven star formation is likely to make merging the dominant mode of star formation in nearby ETGs, in line with evidence for minor mergers being the primary driver of stellar mass growth in these systems.

AB  - We describe the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, a robotic imaging system optimized for the detection of extended ultra--low surface brightness structures. The array consists of eight Canon 400 mm f/2.8 L IS II USM telephoto lenses coupled to eight science-grade commercial CCD cameras. The lenses are mounted on a common framework and are coaligned to simultaneously image the same position on the sky. The system provides an imaging capability equivalent to a 0.4 m aperture f/1.0 refractor with a 2.6$\,^\circ$ × 1.9$\,^\circ$ field of view. The system is driven by custom software for instrument control and robotic operation. Data is collected with noncommon optical paths through each lens, and with careful tracking of sky variations in order to minimize systematic errors that limit the accuracy of background estimation and flat-fielding. The system has no obstructions in the light path, optimized baffling, and internal optical surfaces coated with a new generation of antireflection coatings based on subwavelength nanostructures. As a result, the array''s point-spread function has a factor of ˜10 less scattered light at large radii than well-baffled reflecting telescopes. The Dragonfly Telephoto Array is capable of imaging extended structures to surface brightness levels below muB = 30 mag arcsec-2 in ˜10 h integrations (without binning or foreground star removal). This is considerably deeper than the surface brightness limit of any existing wide-field telescope. At present, no systematic errors limiting the usefulness of much longer integration times have been identified. With longer integrations (50--100 h), foreground star removal, and modest binning, the Dragonfly Telephoto Array is capable of probing structures with surface brightnesses below muB = 32 mag arcsec-2. The detection of structures at these surface brightness levels may hold the key to solving the ""missing substructure"" and ""missing satellite"" problems of conventional hierarchical galaxy formation models. The Dragonfly Telephoto Array is therefore executing a fully automated multiyear imaging survey of a complete sample of nearby galaxies in order to undertake the first census of ultrafaint substructures in the nearby universe.

AB  - We report the discovery of 47 low surface brightness objects in deep images of a 3 x 3 degree field centered on the Coma cluster, obtained with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. The objects have central surface brightness mu(g,0) ranging from 24 - 26 mag/arcsec^2 and effective radii r_e = 3"-10", as measured from archival Canada France Hawaii Telescope images. From their spatial distribution we infer that most or all of the objects are galaxies in the Coma cluster. This relatively large distance is surprising as it implies that the galaxies are very large: with r_e = 1.5 - 4.6 kpc their sizes are similar to those of L* galaxies even though their median stellar mass is only ~6 x 10^7 Solar masses. The galaxies are relatively red and round, with <g-i> = 0.8 and <b/a> = 0.74. One of the 47 galaxies is fortuitously covered by a deep Hubble Space Telescope ACS observation. The ACS imaging shows a large spheroidal object with a central surface brightness mu(g,0) = 25.8 mag/arcsec^2, a Sersic index n=0.6, and an effective radius of 7", corresponding to 3.4 kpc at the distance of Coma. The galaxy is unresolved, as expected for a Coma cluster object. To our knowledge such "ultra-diffuse galaxies" have not been predicted in any modern galaxy formation model. We speculate that UDGs may have lost their gas supply at early times, possibly resulting in very high dark matter fractions.

AB  - We present polarization properties at 1.4 GHz of two separate extragalactic source populations: passive quiescent galaxies and luminous quasar-like galaxies. We use data from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer to determine the host galaxy population of the polarized extragalactic radio sources. The quiescent galaxies have higher percentage polarization, smaller radio linear size, and 1.4 GHz luminosity of 6 × 1021 < L1.4 < 7 × 1025 W Hz-1, while the quasar-like galaxies have smaller percentage polarization, larger radio linear size at radio wavelengths, and a 1.4 GHz luminosity of 9 × 1023 < L1.4 < 7 × 1028 W Hz-1, suggesting that the environment of the quasar-like galaxies is responsible for the lower percentage polarization. Our results confirm previous studies that found an inverse correlation between percentage polarization and total flux density at 1.4 GHz. We suggest that the population change between the polarized extragalactic radio sources is the origin of this inverse correlation and suggest a cosmic evolution of the space density of quiescent galaxies. Finally, we find that the extragalactic contributions to the rotation measures (RMs) of the nearby passive galaxies and the distant quasar-like galaxies are different. After accounting for the RM contributions by cosmological large-scale structure and intervening Mg II absorbers we show that the distribution of intrinsic RMs of the distant quasar-like sources is at most four times as wide as the RM distribution of the nearby quiescent galaxies, if the distribution of intrinsic RMs of the WISE-Star sources itself is at least several rad m-2 wide.

AB  - We investigate Box/Peanut and bar structures in image data of edge-on and face-on nearby galaxies taken from SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) to present catalogues containing the surface brightness parameters and the morphology classification. About 1700 edge-on galaxies and 2600 face-on galaxies are selected from SDSS DR7 in g, r and i-band. The images of each galaxy are fitted with the model of 2-dimensional surface brightness of Sersic bulge and exponential disk. After removing some irregular data, Box/Peanut, bar and other structures are easily distinguished by eye using residual (observed minus model) images. We find 292 Box/Peanut structures in the 1329 edge-on samples and 630 bar structures in 1890 face-on samples in i-band, after removing some irregular data. Then the fraction of Box/Peanut galaxies is about 22 percent against the edge-on samples, and that of bar is about 33 percent (about 50 percent if 629 elliptical galaxies are removed) against the face-on samples. Furthermore the strengths of the Box/Peanut and bar are evaluated as "Strong", "Standard" and "Weak". We find that the strength increases slightly with increasing $B/T$ (Bulge-to-Total flux ratio), and that the fraction of Box/Peanut is generally about a half of that of bar irrespective of the strength and the $B/T$. Our result supports the idea that the Box/Peanut is bar seen edge-on.

AB  - We present a new catalog of 118 Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) and one Hyperluminous Infrared Galaxy (HLIRG) by crossmatching AKARI all-sky survey with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 (SDSS DR10) and the Final Data Release of the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). 40 of the ULIRGs and one HLIRG are new identifications. We find that ULIRGs are interacting pair galaxies or ongoing/post mergers. This is consistent with the widely accepted view: ULIRGs are major mergers of disk galaxies. We confirm the previously known positive trend between the AGN fraction and IR luminosity. We show that ULIRGs have a large off-set from the 'main sequence' up to z~1; their off-set from the z~2 'main sequence' is relatively smaller. We find a consistent result with the previous studies showing that compared to local star forming SDSS galaxies of similar mass, local ULIRGs have lower oxygen abundances. We for the first time demonstrate that ULIRGs follow the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). The scatter of ULIRGs around the FMR (0.09 dex - 0.5 dex) is comparable with the scatter of z~2-3 galaxies. Their optical colors show that ULIRGs are mostly blue galaxies and this agrees with previous findings. We provide the largest local (0.050 < z < 0.487) ULIRG catalog with stellar masses, SFRs, gas metallicities and optical colors. Our catalog provides us active galaxies analogous to high-z galaxies in the local Universe where they can be rigorously scrutinized.

AB  - We study the connection between the large-scale dynamics and the gas fueling toward a central black hole via the analysis of a Milky Way-like simulation at sub-parsec resolution. This allows us to follow a set of processes at various scales (e.g., the triggering of inward gas motion towards inner resonances via the large-scale bar, the connection to the central black hole via mini spirals) in a self-consistent manner. This simulation provides further insights on the role of shear for the inhibition of star formation within the bar in regions with significant amount of gas. We also witness the decoupling of the central gas and nuclear cluster from the large-scale disc, via interactions with the black hole. This break of symmetry in the mass distribution triggers the formation of gas clumps organised in a time-varying 250 pc ring-like structure, the black hole being offset by about 70 pc from its centre. Some clumps form stars, while most get disrupted or merge. Supernovae feedback further creates bubbles and filaments, some of the gas being expelled to 100 pc or higher above the galaxy plane. This helps remove angular momentum from the gas, which gets closer to the central dark mass. Part of the gas raining down is being accreted, forming a 10~pc polar disc-like structure around the black hole, leading to an episode of star formation. This gives rise to multiple stellar populations with significantly different angular momentum vectors, and may lead to a natural intermittence in the fueling of the black hole.

AB  - This special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters is dedicated to presenting initial results from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) that are primarily, but not exclusively, based on multiband imaging data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The survey covers roughly 320 arcmin2 in the ACS F435W, F606W, F814W, and F850LP bands, divided into two well-studied fields. Existing deep observations from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and ground-based facilities are supplemented with new, deep imaging in the optical and near-infrared from the European Southern Observatory and from the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Deep observations with the Space Infrared Telescope Facility are scheduled. Reduced data from all facilities are being released worldwide within 3-6 months of acquisition. Together, this data set provides two deep reference fields for studies of distant normal and active galaxies, supernovae, and faint stars in our own Galaxy. This Letter serves to outline the survey strategy and describe the specific data that have been used in the accompanying letters, summarizing the reduction procedures and sensitivity limits.  Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555 observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile (ESO programmes 168.A-0845, 64.O-0643, 66.A-0572, 68.A-0544, 164-O-0561, 169.A-0725, 267.A-5729, 66.A-0451, 68.A-0375, 168.A-0485, 164.O-0561, 267.A-5729, 169.A-0725, 64.O-0621, and 170.A-0788) and observations collected at the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO), National Optical Astronomical Observatories (NOAO), which is operated by AURA, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.

AB  - Blazars are classically divided into the BL Lac (BLL) and Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) subclasses, corresponding to radiatively inefficient and efficient accretion regimes, respectively, largely based on the equivalent width (EW) of their optical broad emission lines (BEL). However, EW-based classification criteria are not physically motivated, and a few blazars have previously 'transitioned' from one subclass to the other. We present the first systematic search for these transition blazars in a sample of 602 unique pairs of repeat spectra of 354 blazars in SDSS, finding six clear cases. These transition blazars have bolometric Eddington ratios of ~0.3 and low-frequency synchrotron peaks, and are thus FSRQ-like. We show that the strong EW variability (up to an unprecedented factor of >60) is due to swamping of the BELs from variability in jet continuum emission, which is stronger in amplitude and shorter in timescale than typical blazars. Although these transition blazars appear to switch between FSRQ and BLL according to the phenomenologically-based EW scheme, we show that they are most likely rare cases of FSRQs with radiatively efficient accretion flows and especially strongly-beamed jets. These results have implications for the decrease of the apparent BLL population at high-redshifts, and may add credence to claims of a negative BLL redshift evolution.

AB  - We present a clustering analysis of X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) by compiling X-ray samples from the literature and re-estimating the dark-matter (DM) halo masses of AGN in a uniform manner. We find that moderate-luminosity AGN (L2-10 keV ~= 1042-1044 erg s-1) in the z ~= 0-1.3 Universe are typically found in DM haloes with masses of ˜1013 M&sun;. We then compare our findings to the theoretical predictions of the coupled galaxy and black hole formation model GALFORM. We find good agreement when our calculation includes the hot-halo mode of accretion on to the central black hole. This type of accretion, which is additional to the common cold accretion during disc instabilities and galaxy mergers, is tightly coupled to the AGN feedback in the model. The hot-halo mode becomes prominent in DM haloes with masses greater than ˜1012.5 M&sun;, where AGN feedback typically operates, giving rise to a distinct class of moderate-luminosity AGN that inhabit rich clusters and superclusters. Cold gas fuelling of the black hole cannot produce the observationally inferred DM halo masses of X-ray AGN. Switching off AGN feedback in the model results in a large population of luminous quasars (L2-10 keV > 1044 erg s-1) in DM haloes with masses up to ˜1014 M&sun;, which is inconsistent with the observed clustering of quasars. The abundance of hot-halo AGN decreases significantly in the z ~= 3-4 universe. At such high redshifts, the cold accretion mode is solely responsible for shaping the environment of moderate-luminosity AGN. Our analysis supports two accretion modes (cold and hot) for the fuelling of supermassive black holes and strongly underlines the importance of AGN feedback in cosmological models both of galaxy formation and black hole growth.

AB  - We present a study of Spitzer/IRAC and X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) selection techniques in order to quantify the overlap, uniqueness, contamination, and completeness of each. We investigate how the overlap and possible contamination of the samples depend on the depth of both the IR and X-ray data. We use Spitzer/IRAC imaging, Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging, and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey to construct galaxy and AGN samples at 0.2 < z < 1.2 over 8 deg2. We construct samples over a wide range of IRAC flux limits (SWIRE to GOODS depth) and X-ray flux limits (10 ks to 2 Ms). We compare IR-AGN samples defined using both the IRAC color selection of Stern et al. and Donley et al. with X-ray-detected AGN samples. For roughly similar depth IR and X-ray surveys, we find that ~75% of IR-selected AGNs are also identified as X-ray AGNs. This fraction increases to ~90% when comparing against the deepest X-ray data, indicating that at most ~10% of IR-selected AGNs may be heavily obscured. The IR-AGN selection proposed by Stern et al. suffers from contamination by star-forming galaxies at various redshifts when using deeper IR data, though the selection technique works well for shallow IR data. While similar overall, the IR-AGN samples preferentially contain more luminous AGNs, while the X-ray AGN samples identify a wider range of AGN accretion rates including low specific accretion rate AGNs, where the host galaxy light dominates at IR wavelengths. The host galaxy populations of the IR and X-ray AGN samples have similar rest-frame colors and stellar masses; both selections identify AGNs in blue, star-forming and red, quiescent galaxies.

AB  - We measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in the largest-ever galaxy redshift survey, the main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Seventh Data Release. We focus on the projected correlation function wp (rp ) of volume-limited samples, extracted from the parent sample of ~700,000 galaxies over 8000 deg2, extending up to redshift of 0.25. We interpret our measurements using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling assuming a LambdaCDM cosmology (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant). The amplitude of wp (rp ) grows slowly with luminosity for L < L * and increases sharply at higher luminosities, with a large-scale bias factor b(> L) × (sigma8/0.8) = 1.06 + 0.21(L/L *)1.12, where L is the sample luminosity threshold. At fixed luminosity, redder galaxies exhibit a higher amplitude and steeper correlation function, a steady trend that runs through the "blue cloud" and "green valley" and continues across the "red sequence." The cross-correlation of red and blue galaxies is close to the geometric mean of their autocorrelations, dropping slightly below at rp < 1 h -1 Mpc. The luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations separately are strikingly different. Blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of clustering strength with luminosity, with nearly constant shape of wp (rp ). The large-scale clustering of red galaxies shows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at L > 4 L *, but the lowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 L *) show very strong clustering on small scales (rp < 2 h -1 Mpc). Most of the observed trends can be naturally understood within the LambdaCDM+HOD framework. The growth of wp (rp ) for higher luminosity galaxies reflects an overall shift in the mass scale of their host dark matter halos, in particular an increase in the minimum host halo mass M min. The mass at which a halo has, on average, one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M 1 ≈ 17 M min(L) over most of the luminosity range, with a smaller ratio above L *. The growth and steepening of wp (rp ) for redder galaxies reflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in high-mass halos instead of central systems in low-mass halos, a trend that is especially marked at low luminosities. Our extensive measurements, provided in tabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxy formation, a firm grounding of semiempirical models of the galaxy population, and new constraints on cosmological parameters from combining real-space galaxy clustering with mass-sensitive statistics such as redshift-space distortions, cluster mass-to-light ratios, and galaxy-galaxy lensing.

AB  - We explore the connection between different classes of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the evolution of their host galaxies, by deriving host galaxy properties, clustering, and Eddington ratios of AGNs selected in the radio, X-ray, and infrared (IR) wavebands. We study a sample of 585 AGNs at 0.25 < z < 0.8 using redshifts from the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES). We select AGNs with observations in the radio at 1.4 GHz from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, X-rays from the Chandra XBoötes Survey, and mid-IR from the Spitzer IRAC Shallow Survey. The radio, X-ray, and IR AGN samples show only modest overlap, indicating that to the flux limits of the survey, they represent largely distinct classes of AGNs. We derive host galaxy colors and luminosities, as well as Eddington ratios, for obscured or optically faint AGNs. We also measure the two-point cross-correlation between AGNs and galaxies on scales of 0.3-10 h -1 Mpc, and derive typical dark matter halo masses. We find that: (1) radio AGNs are mainly found in luminous red sequence galaxies, are strongly clustered (with M halo ~ 3 × 1013 h -1 M sun), and have very low Eddington ratios lambda lsim 10-3 (2) X-ray-selected AGNs are preferentially found in galaxies that lie in the "green valley" of color-magnitude space and are clustered similar to the typical AGES galaxies (M halo ~ 1013 h -1 M sun), with 10-3 lsim lambda lsim 1; (3) IR AGNs reside in slightly bluer, slightly less luminous galaxies than X-ray AGNs, are weakly clustered (M halo lsim 1012 h -1 M sun), and have lambda>10-2. We interpret these results in terms of a simple model of AGN and galaxy evolution, whereby a "quasar" phase and the growth of the stellar bulge occurs when a galaxy's dark matter halo reaches a critical mass between ~1012 and 1013 M sun. After this event, star formation ceases and AGN accretion shifts from radiatively efficient (optical- and IR-bright) to radiatively inefficient (optically faint, radio-bright) modes.

AB  - We measure the clustering of nonquasar X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 0.7-1.4 in the AEGIS field. Using the cross-correlation of 113 Chandra-selected AGN, with a median log L X = 42.8 erg s-1, with ~5000 DEEP2 galaxies, we find that the X-ray AGNs are fitted by a power law with a clustering scale length of r 0 = 5.95 $\pm$ 0.90 h -1 Mpc and slope gamma = 1.66 $\pm$ 0.22. X-ray AGNs have a similar clustering amplitude as red, quiescent and "green" transition galaxies at z ~ 1 and are significantly more clustered than blue, star-forming galaxies. The X-ray AGN clustering strength is primarily determined by the host galaxy color; AGNs in red host galaxies are significantly more clustered than AGNs in blue host galaxies, with a relative bias that is similar to that of red to blue DEEP2 galaxies. We detect no dependence of clustering on optical brightness, X-ray luminosity, or hardness ratio within the ranges probed here. We find evidence for galaxies hosting X-ray AGN to be more clustered than a sample of galaxies with matching joint optical color and magnitude distributions. This implies that galaxies hosting X-ray AGN are more likely to reside in groups and more massive dark matter halos than galaxies of the same color and luminosity without an X-ray AGN. In comparison to optically selected quasars in the DEEP2 fields, we find that X-ray AGNs at z ~ 1 are more clustered than optically selected quasars (with a 2.6sigma significance) and therefore may reside in more massive dark matter halos. Our results are consistent with galaxies undergoing a quasar phase while in the blue cloud before settling on the red sequence with a lower-luminosity X-ray AGN, if they are similar objects at different evolutionary stages.

AB  - Galaxies are not uniformly distributed in space. On large scales, the Universe displays coherent structure, with galaxies residing in groups and clusters on scales of ˜ 1-3 h - 1 Mpc, which lie at the intersections of long filaments of galaxies that are > 10 h - 1 Mpc in length. Vast regions of relatively empty space, known as voids, contain very few galaxies and span the volume in between these structures. This observed large-scale structure depends both on cosmological parameters and on the formation and evolution of galaxies. Using the two-point correlation function, one can trace the dependence of large-scale structure on galaxy properties, such as luminosity, color, stellar mass, and track its evolution with redshift. Comparison of the observed galaxy clustering signatures with dark matter simulations allows one to model and understand the clustering of galaxies and their formation and evolution within their parent dark matter halos. Clustering measurements can determine the parent dark matter halo mass of a given galaxy population, connect observed galaxy populations at different epochs, and constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy evolution models. This chapter describes the methods used to measure the two-point correlation function in both redshift and real space, presents the current results of how the clustering amplitude depends on various galaxy properties, and discusses quantitative measurements of the structures of voids and filaments. The interpretation of these results with current theoretical models is also presented.

AB  - We use deep Herschel Space Observatory observations of a 90% complete sample of 32 intermediate-redshift 2Jy radio galaxies (0.05 < z < 0.7) to estimate the dust masses of their host galaxies and thereby investigate the triggering mechanisms for their quasar-like AGN. The dust masses derived for the radio galaxies (7.2x10^5 < M_d < 2.6x10^8 M_sun) are intermediate between those of quiescent elliptical galaxies on the one hand, and ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) on the other. Consistent with simple models for the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, these results suggest that most of the radio galaxies represent the late time re-triggering of AGN activity via mergers between the host giant elliptical galaxies and companion galaxies with relatively low gas masses. However, a minority of the radio galaxies in our sample (~20%) have high, ULIRG-like dust masses, along with evidence for prodigious star formation activity. The latter objects are more likely to have been triggered in major, gas-rich mergers that represent a rapid growth phase for both their host galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

AB  - We present a highly complete and reliable mid-infrared (MIR) colour selection of luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates using the 3.4, 4.6 and 12 mum bands of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) survey. The MIR colour wedge was defined using the wide-angle Bright Ultrahard XMM-Newton survey (BUXS), one of the largest complete flux-limited samples of bright (f4.5-10 keV >6×10-14 erg s-1 cm -2) 'ultrahard' (4.5-10  keV) X-ray-selected AGN to date. The BUXS includes 258 objects detected over a total sky area of 44.43 deg2 of which 251 are spectroscopically identified and classified, with 145 being type 1 AGN and 106 type 2 AGN. Our technique is designed to select objects with red MIR power-law spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in the three shortest bands of WISE and properly accounts for the errors in the photometry and deviations of the MIR SEDs from a pure power-law. The completeness of the MIR selection is a strong function of luminosity. At L2-10 keV >1044   erg s-1, where the AGN is expected to dominate the MIR emission, 97.1-4.8+2.2 and 76.5-18.4+13.3 per cent of the BUXS type 1 and type 2 AGN, respectively, meet the selection. Our technique shows one of the highest reliability and efficiency of detection of the X-ray-selected luminous AGN population with WISE amongst those in the literature. In the area covered by BUXS our selection identifies 2755 AGN candidates detected with signal-to-noise ratio >=5 in the three shorter wavelength bands of WISE with 38.5 per cent having a detection at 2-10 keV X-ray energies. We also analysed the possibility of including the 22  mum WISE band to select AGN candidates, but neither the completeness nor the reliability of the selection improves. This is likely due to both the significantly shallower depth at 22 mum compared with the first three bands of WISE and star formation contributing to the 22 mum emission at the WISE 22 mum sensitivity.

AB  - We conducted a quantitative analysis of ten citizen science projects hosted on the Zooniverse platform, using a data set of over 50 million activity records and more than 250,000 users, collected between December 2010 and July 2013. We examined the level of participation of users in Zooniverse discussion forums in relation to their contributions toward the completion of scientific (micro-)tasks. As Zooniverse is home to a multitude of projects, we were also interested in the emergence of cross-projects effects, and identified those project characteristics, most importantly the subject domain and the duration of a project. We also looked into the adoption of expert terminology, showing that this phenomenon is dependent on the scientific domain which a project addresses but also affected by how the communication features are actually used by a community. This is the first study of this kind in this increasingly important class of online community, and its insights will inform the design and further development of the Zooniverse platform, and of citizen science systems as a whole.

AB  - The knowledge commons research framework is applied to a case of commons governance grounded in research in modern astronomy. The case, Galaxy Zoo, is a leading example of at least three different contemporary phenomena. In the first place Galaxy Zoo is a global citizen science project, in which volunteer non-scientists have been recruited to participate in large-scale data analysis via the Internet. In the second place Galaxy Zoo is a highly successful example of peer production, sometimes known colloquially as crowdsourcing, by which data are gathered, supplied, and/or analyzed by very large numbers of anonymous and pseudonymous contributors to an enterprise that is centrally coordinated or managed. In the third place Galaxy Zoo is a highly visible example of data-intensive science, sometimes referred to as e-science or Big Data science, by which scientific researchers develop methods to grapple with the massive volumes of digital data now available to them via modern sensing and imaging technologies. This chapter synthesizes these three perspectives on Galaxy Zoo via the knowledge commons framework.

AB  - We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 to empirically quantify the stellar-mass and black hole growth triggered by minor mergers in local spiral (disc) galaxies. Since major mergers destroy discs and create spheroids, morphologically disturbed spirals are likely remnants of minor mergers. Disturbed spirals exhibit enhanced specific star formation rates (SSFRs), the enhancement increasing in galaxies of `later' morphological type (which have more gas and smaller bulges). By combining the SSFR enhancements with the fraction of time spirals spend in this `enhanced' mode, we estimate that ˜40 per cent of the star formation in local spirals is directly triggered by minor mergers. The disturbed spirals also exhibit higher nuclear-accretion rates, implying that minor mergers enhance the growth rate of the central black hole. However, the specific accretion rate shows a lower enhancement than that in the SSFR, suggesting that the coupling between stellar-mass and black hole growth is weak in minor-merger-driven episodes. Given the significant fraction of star formation that is triggered by minor mergers, this weaker coupling may contribute to the large intrinsic scatter observed in the stellar versus black hole mass relation in spirals. Combining our results with the star formation in early-type galaxies - which is minor-merger-driven and accounts for ˜14 per cent of the star formation budget - suggests that around half of the star formation activity in the local Universe is triggered by the minor-merger process.

AB  - We study the significance of major-merger-driven star formation in the early Universe, by quantifying the contribution of this process to the total star formation budget in 80 massive (M* > 1010 M&sun;) galaxies at z ~= 2. Employing visually classified morphologies from rest-frame V-band Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, we find that 55$\pm$14 per cent of the star formation budget is hosted by non-interacting late types, with 27$\pm$8 per cent in major mergers and 18$\pm$6 per cent in spheroids. Given that a system undergoing a major merger continues to experience star formation driven by other processes at this epoch (e.g. cold accretion and minor mergers), ˜27 per cent is an upper limit to the major-merger contribution to star formation activity at this epoch. The ratio of the average specific star formation rate in major mergers to that in the non-interacting late types is ˜2.2:1, suggesting that the enhancement of star formation due to major merging is typically modest, and that just under half the star formation in systems experiencing major mergers is unrelated to the merger itself. Taking this into account, we estimate that the actual major-merger contribution to the star formation budget may be as low as ˜15 per cent. While our study does not preclude a major-merger-dominated era in the very early Universe, if the major-merger contribution to star formation does not evolve strongly into larger look-back times, then this process has a relatively insignificant role in driving stellar mass assembly over cosmic time.

AB  - The polarized thermal emission from Galactic dust is the main foreground present in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at frequencies above 100GHz. We exploit the Planck HFI polarization data from 100 to 353GHz to measure the dust angular power spectra $C_\ell^EE,BB$ over the range $40<\ell<600$. These will bring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determination of the level of contamination for CMB polarization experiments. We show that statistical properties of the emission can be characterized over large fractions of the sky using $C_\ell$. For the dust, they are well described by power laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^EE,BB=-2.42\pm0.02$. The amplitudes of the polarization $C_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in a way similar to the intensity ones. The dust polarization frequency dependence is consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and $T_d=19.6$K. We find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the Galactic $B$- and $E$-modes of 0.5. We show that even in the faintest dust-emitting regions there are no "clean" windows where primordial CMB $B$-mode polarization could be measured without subtraction of dust emission. Finally, we investigate the level of dust polarization in the BICEP2 experiment field. Extrapolation of the Planck 353GHz data to 150GHz gives a dust power $\ell(\ell+1)C_\ell^BB/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^-2\mu$K$_CMB^2$ over the $40<\ell<120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is an additional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the same units. This is the same magnitude as reported by BICEP2 over this $\ell$ range, which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal. The present uncertainties will be reduced through an ongoing, joint analysis of the Planck and BICEP2 data sets.

AB  - We study the correlation between galaxy structure and the quenching of star formation using a sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey central galaxies with stellar masses 9.75 < log M */M &sun; < 11.25 and redshifts z < 0.075. Galaxy Evolution Explorer UV data are used to cleanly divide the sample into star-forming and quenched galaxies and to identify galaxies in transition (the green valley). Despite a stark difference in visual appearance between blue and red galaxies, their average radial stellar mass density profiles are remarkably similar (especially in the outer regions) at fixed mass. The inner stellar mass surface density within a radius of 1 kpc, Sigma1, is used to quantify the growth of the bulge as galaxies evolve. When galaxies are divided into narrow mass bins, their distribution in the color-Sigma1 plane at fixed mass forms plausible evolutionary tracks. Sigma1 seems to grow as galaxies evolve through the blue cloud, and once it crosses a threshold value, galaxies are seen to quench at fixed Sigma1. The Sigma1 threshold for quenching grows with stellar mass, \Sigma _1\propto M_*^0.64. However, the existence of some star-forming galaxies above the threshold Sigma1 implies that a dense bulge is necessary but not sufficient to quench a galaxy fully. This would be consistent with a two-step quenching process in which gas within a galaxy is removed or stabilized against star formation by bulge-driven processes (such as a starburst, active galactic nucleus feedback, or morphological quenching), whereas external gas accretion is suppressed by separate halo-driven processes (such as halo gas shock heating). Quenching thus depends on an interplay between the inner structure of a galaxy and its surrounding dark matter halo, and lack of perfect synchrony between the two could produce the observed scatter in color versus Sigma1.

AB  - Recent observations indicate a remarkable similarity in the properties of evolving galaxies at fixed mass and redshift, prompting us to consider the possibility that most galaxies may evolve with a common history encompassing star formation, quasar accretion, and eventual quiescence. We quantify this by defining a "synchronization timescale" for galaxies as a function of mass and redshift that characterizes the extent to which different galaxies of a common mass are evolving in the same manner at various cosmic epochs. We measure this synchronization timescale using 9 different star-forming galaxy observations from the literature and SDSS quasar observations spanning $0 < z \lesssim 6$. Surprisingly, this synchronization timescale is a constant, approximately 1.5 Gyr for all combinations of mass and time. We also find that the ratio between the stellar mass of galaxies turning off star formation and black hole mass of turnoff quasars is approximately 30:1, much lower than the 500:1 for quiescent galaxies at low redshift. As a result, we propose a model in which the star-forming "main sequence", analogous quasar behavior, and other observations form a galactic evolution "main sequence", in which star formation occurs earliest, followed by supermassive black hole accretion, and feedback between the two are dominated by deterministic rather than stochastic processes.

AB  - Proposal success rates are calculated for HST Cycles 11 through 21 as a function of the gender of the Principal Investigator (PI). In each cycle, proposals with male PIs have a higher success rate, with the disparity greatest for Cycles 12 and 18. The offsets are small enough that they might be ascribed to chance for any single cycle, but the consistent pattern suggests the presence of a systematic effect. Closer inspection of results from Cycles 19, 20 and 21 shows that the systematic difference does not appear to depend on the geographic origin of the proposal nor does it depend on the gender distribution on the review panels. Segregating proposals by the seniority of the PI, the success rates by gender for more recent graduates (Ph.d. since 2000) are more closely comparable. There is also a correlation between success by gender and the average seniority of the review panel for Cycles 19 and 20, but not Cycle 21. We discuss these results and some consequent changes to the proposal format and additions to the HST TAC orientation process.

AB  - We analyze the observed properties of nested and single stellar bar systems in disk galaxies. The 112 galaxies in our sample comprise the largest matched Seyfert versus non-Seyfert galaxy sample of nearby galaxies with complete near-infrared or optical imaging sensitive to length scales ranging from tens of parsecs to tens of kiloparsecs. The presence of bars is deduced by fitting ellipses to isophotes in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) H-band images up to 10" radius and in ground-based near-infrared and optical images outside the H-band images. This is a conservative approach that is likely to result in an underestimate of the true bar fraction. We find that a significant fraction of the sample galaxies, 17%+/-4%, have more than one bar, and that 28%+/-5% of barred galaxies have nested bars. The bar fractions appear to be stable according to reasonable changes in our adopted bar criteria. For the nested bars, we detect a clear division in length between the large-scale (primary) bars and small-scale (secondary) bars, in both absolute and normalized (to the size of the galaxy) length. We argue that this bimodal distribution can be understood within the framework of disk resonances, specifically the inner Lindblad resonances (ILRs), which are located where the gravitational potential of the innermost galaxy switches effectively from three-dimensional to two-dimensional. This conclusion is further strengthened by the observed distribution of the sizes of nuclear rings which are dynamically associated with the ILRs. While primary bar sizes are found to correlate with the host galaxy sizes, no such correlation is observed for the secondary bars. Moreover, we find that secondary bars differ morphologically from single bars. Our matched Seyfert and non-Seyfert samples show a statistically significant excess of bars among the Seyfert galaxies at practically all length scales. We confirm our previous results that bars are more abundant in Seyfert hosts than in non-Seyfert galaxies and that Seyfert galaxies always show a preponderance of ``thick'' bars compared to the bars in non-Seyfert galaxies. Finally, no correlation is observed between the presence of a bar and that of companion galaxies, even relatively bright ones. Overall, since star formation and dust extinction can be significant even in the H band, the stellar dynamics of the central kiloparsec cannot always be revealed reliably by the use of near-infrared surface photometry alone.

AB  - We present a detailed study of the bar fraction in the CfA sample of Seyfert galaxies and in a carefully selected control sample of nonactive galaxies to investigate the relation between the presence of bars and of nuclear activity. To avoid the problems related to bar classification in the Third Reference Catalogue (RC3), e.g., subjectivity, low resolution, and contamination by dust, we have developed an objective bar classification method, which we conservatively apply to our new subarcsecond resolution near-infrared (NIR) imaging data set discussed in the first paper in this series. We are able to use stringent criteria based on radial profiles of ellipticity and major axis position angle to determine the presence of a bar and its axial ratio. Concentrating on noninteracting galaxies in our sample for which morphological information can be obtained, we find that Seyfert hosts are barred more often (79%+/-7.5%) than the nonactive galaxies in our control sample (59%+/-9%), a result which is at the ~2.5 sigma significance level. The fraction of nonaxisymmetric hosts becomes even larger when interacting galaxies are taken into account. We discuss the implications of this result for the fueling of central activity by large-scale bars. This paper improves on previous work by means of imaging at higher spatial resolution and by the use of a set of stringent criteria for bar presence and confirms that the use of NIR is superior to optical imaging for detection of bars in disk galaxies.

AB  - We present empirical constraints on the influence of stellar bars on the fueling of active galactic nuclei (AGN) out to z=0.84 using a sample of X-ray-selected AGN hosted in luminous face-on disk galaxies from the Chandra COSMOS survey. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging to identify bars, we find that the fraction of barred active galaxies displays a similar behavior as that of inactive spirals, declining with redshift from 71% at z~0.3, to 35% at z~0.8. With active galaxies being typically massive, we compare them against a mass-matched sample of inactive spirals and find that the AGN bar fraction is higher, with this enhancement being marginal at z>0.4, but becoming more pronounced at low redshift. The presence of a bar has no influence on the AGN strength, with barred and unbarred active galaxies showing equivalent X-ray luminosity distributions, though barred galaxies on average seem to show higher levels of central star formation. From our results, we conclude that the role of bars is restricted to providing the suitable conditions for BH fueling to occur, i.e., bring a fresh supply of gas to the central 100 pc. Beyond this point, the efficiency of the fueling process is independent of the large scale structure of a galaxy. At the high-redshift end, roughly 60% of active disk galaxies are unbarred. We speculate this to be related with the dynamical state of disks at higher redshifts which inhibits bar formation: being more gas-rich and turbulent than local spirals, these conditions could lead to instabilities and inflows, potentially providing the fuel supply for these AGN.

AB  - We present a set of low-resolution empirical spectral energy distribution (SED) templates for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies in the wavelength range from 0.03 mum to 30 mum based on the multi-wavelength photometric observations of the NOAO Deep-Wide Field Survey Boötes field and the spectroscopic observations of the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey. Our training sample is comprised of 14,448 galaxies in the redshift range 0 <~ z <~ 1 and 5347 likely AGNs in the range 0 <~ z <~ 5.58. The galaxy templates correspond to the SED templates presented in 2008 by Assef et al. extended into the UV and mid-IR by the addition of FUV and NUV GALEX and MIPS 24 mum data for the field. We use our templates to determine photometric redshifts for galaxies and AGNs. While they are relatively accurate for galaxies (sigma z /(1 + z) = 0.04, with 5% outlier rejection), their accuracies for AGNs are a strong function of the luminosity ratio between the AGN and galaxy components. Somewhat surprisingly, the relative luminosities of the AGN and its host are well determined even when the photometric redshift is significantly in error. We also use our templates to study the mid-IR AGN selection criteria developed by Stern et al. in 2005 and Lacy et al. in 2004. We find that the Stern et al. criterion suffers from significant incompleteness when there is a strong host galaxy component and at z ~= 4.5, when the broad Halpha emission line is redshifted into the [3.6] band, but that it is little contaminated by low- and intermediate-redshift galaxies. The Lacy et al. criterion is not affected by incompleteness at z ~= 4.5 and is somewhat less affected by strong galaxy host components, but is heavily contaminated by low-redshift star-forming galaxies. Finally, we use our templates to predict the color-color distribution of sources in the upcoming Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission and define a color criterion to select AGNs analogous to those developed for IRAC photometry. We estimate that in between 640,000 and 1,700,000 AGNs will be identified by these criteria, but without additional information, WISE-selected quasars will have serious completeness problems for z >~ 3.4.

AB  - Stern et al. presented a study of Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) selection of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the 2 deg2 COSMOS field, finding that a simple criterion W1-W2 >= 0.8 provides a highly reliable and complete AGN sample for W2 < 15.05, where the W1 and W2 passbands are centered at 3.4 mum and 4.6 mum, respectively. Here we extend this study using the larger 9 deg2 NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey Boötes field which also has considerably deeper WISE observations than the COSMOS field, and find that this simple color cut significantly loses reliability at fainter fluxes. We define a modified selection criterion combining the W1-W2 color and the W2 magnitude to provide highly reliable or highly complete AGN samples for fainter WISE sources. In particular, we define a color-magnitude cut that finds 130 $\pm$ 4 deg-2 AGN candidates for W2 < 17.11 with 90% reliability. Using the extensive UV through mid-IR broadband photometry available in this field, we study the spectral energy distributions of WISE AGN candidates. We find that, as expected, the WISE AGN selection can identify highly obscured AGNs, but that it is biased toward objects where the AGN dominates the bolometric luminosity output. We study the distribution of reddening in the AGN sample and discuss a formalism to account for sample incompleteness based on the step-wise maximum-likelihood method of Efstathiou et al. The resulting dust obscuration distributions depend strongly on AGN luminosity, consistent with the trend expected for a receding torus. At L AGN ~ 3 × 1044 erg s-1, 29% $\pm$ 7% of AGNs are observed as Type 1, while at ~4 × 1045 erg s-1 the fraction is 64% $\pm$ 13%. The distribution of obscuration values suggests that dust in the torus is present as both a diffuse medium and in optically thick clouds.

AB  - Spitzer/IRAC selection is a powerful tool for identifying luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs). For deep IRAC data, however, the AGN selection wedges currently in use are heavily contaminated by star-forming galaxies, especially at high redshift. Using the large samples of luminous AGNs and high-redshift star-forming galaxies in COSMOS, we redefine the AGN selection criteria for use in deep IRAC surveys. The new IRAC criteria are designed to be both highly complete and reliable, and incorporate the best aspects of the current AGN selection wedges and of infrared power-law selection while excluding high-redshift star-forming galaxies selected via the BzK, distant red galaxy, Lyman-break galaxy, and submillimeter galaxy criteria. At QSO luminosities of log L 2-10 keV(erg s-1) >=44, the new IRAC criteria recover 75% of the hard X-ray and IRAC-detected XMM-COSMOS sample, yet only 38% of the IRAC AGN candidates have X-ray counterparts, a fraction that rises to 52% in regions with Chandra exposures of 50-160 ks. X-ray stacking of the individually X-ray non-detected AGN candidates leads to a hard X-ray signal indicative of heavily obscured to mildly Compton-thick obscuration (log N H (cm-2) = 23.5 $\pm$ 0.4). While IRAC selection recovers a substantial fraction of luminous unobscured and obscured AGNs, it is incomplete to low-luminosity and host-dominated AGNs.

AB  - We present a new algorithm, named Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition (AGD), for automatically decomposing spectra into Gaussian components. AGD uses derivative spectroscopy and machine learning to provide optimized guesses for the number of Gaussian components in the data, and also their locations, widths, and amplitudes. We test AGD and find that it produces results comparable to human-derived solutions on 21cm absorption spectra from the 21cm SPectral line Observations of Neutral Gas with the EVLA (21-SPONGE) survey. We use AGD with Monte Carlo methods to derive the HI line completeness as a function of peak optical depth and velocity width for the 21-SPONGE data, and also show that the results of AGD are stable against varying observational noise intensity. The autonomy and computational efficiency of the method over traditional manual Gaussian fits allow for truly unbiased comparisons between observations and simulations, and for the ability to scale up and interpret the very large data volumes from the upcoming Square Kilometer Array and pathfinder telescopes.

AB  - We present the discovery of a prominent bifurcation between early-type galaxies and late-type galaxies, in [4.6]-[12] micron colors from the Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We then use an emission-line diagnostic comparison sample to explore the nature of objects found both within, and near the edges of, this WISE infrared transition zone (IRTZ). We hypothesize that this birfurcation might be due to the presence of hot dust and PAH emission features in late-type galaxies. Using a sample of galaxies selected through the Shocked Poststarburst Galaxy Survey (SPOGS), we are able to identify galaxies with strong Balmer absorption (EW(Hdelta)>5 Angstroms) as well as emission lines inconsistent with star formation (deemed SPOG candidates, or SPOGs*) that lie within the optical green valley. Seyferts and low ionization nuclear emission line regions, whose u-r colors tend to be red, are strongly represented within the IRTZ, whereas SPOGs* tend to sit near the star-forming edge. Although AGN are well-represented in the IRTZ, we argue that the dominant IRTZ population are galaxies that are in late stages of transitioning across the optical green valley, shedding the last of their remnant interstellar media.

AB  - We report on the measurement of the physical properties (rest-frame K-band luminosity and total stellar mass) of the hosts of 89 broad-line (type-1) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected in the zCOSMOS survey in the redshift range 1 < z < 2.2. The unprecedented multi-wavelength coverage of the survey field allows us to disentangle the emission of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We derive an estimate of black hole masses through the analysis of the broad Mg II emission lines observed in the medium-resolution spectra taken with VIMOS/VLT as part of the zCOSMOS project. We found that, as compared to the local value, the average black hole to host-galaxy mass ratio appears to evolve positively with redshift, with a best-fit evolution of the form (1+z)^0.68 $\pm$ 0.12 ^+0.6_-0.3, where the large asymmetric systematic errors stem from the uncertainties in the choice of initial mass function, in the calibration of the virial relation used to estimate BH masses and in the mean QSO SED adopted. On the other hand, if we consider the observed rest-frame K-band luminosity, objects tend to be brighter, for a given black hole mass, than those on the local M BH-MK relation. This fact, together with more indirect evidence from the SED fitting itself, suggests that the AGN hosts are likely actively star-forming galaxies. A thorough analysis of observational biases induced by intrinsic scatter in the scaling relations reinforces the conclusion that an evolution of the M BH-M * relation must ensue for actively growing black holes at early times: either its overall normalization, or its intrinsic scatter (or both) appear to increase with redshift. This can be interpreted as signature of either a more rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift, a change of structural properties of AGN hosts at earlier times, or a significant mismatch between the typical growth times of nuclear black holes and host galaxies. In any case, our results provide important clues on the nature of the early co-evolution of black holes and galaxies and challenging tests for models of AGN feedback and self-regulated growth of structures.

AB  - We have reexamined the relation between the mass of the central black holes in nearby galaxies, Mbh, and the stellar mass of the surrounding spheroid or bulge, Mbulge. For a total of 30 galaxies bulge masses were derived through Jeans equation modeling or adopted from dynamical models in the literature. In stellar mass-to-light ratios, the spheroids and bulges span a range of a factor of 8. The bulge masses were related to well-determined black hole masses taken from the literature. With these improved values for Mbh, compared to Magorrian et al., and our redetermination of Mbulge, we find that the Mbh-Mbulge relation becomes very tight. We find Mbh~M1.12+/-0.06bulge with an observed scatter of <~0.30 dex, a fraction of which can be attributed to measurement errors. The scatter in this relation is therefore comparable to the scatter in the relations of Mbh with sigma and the stellar concentration. These results confirm and refine the work of Marconi & Hunt. For Mbulge~5×1010 Msolar the median black hole mass is 0.14%+/-0.04% of the bulge mass.

AB  - We introduce the Virgo Consortium's EAGLE project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and black holes in representative volumes. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and AGN in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the z~0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to $\lesssim 0.2$ dex over the full mass range, $10^8 < M_*/M_\odot \lesssim 10^11$, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic CIV and OVI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for $M_* \gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$, they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. The gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. EAGLE constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.

AB  - We measure star formation rates (SFRs) of ~50,000 optically selected galaxies in the local universe (z~0.1)-from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (Halpha). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to Halpha measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak Halpha, and where Halpha is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without Halpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no Halpha show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.

AB  - We use publicly available galaxy merger trees, obtained applying semi-analytic techniques to a large high-resolution cosmological simulation, to study the environmental history of group and cluster galaxies. Our results highlight the existence of an intrinsic history bias which makes the nature versus nurture (as well as the mass versus environment) debate inherently ill posed. In particular, we show that (i) surviving massive satellites were accreted later than their less massive counterparts, from more massive haloes and (ii) the mixing of galaxy populations is incomplete during halo assembly, which creates a correlation between the time a galaxy becomes satellite and its present distance from the parent halo centre. The weakest trends are found for the most massive satellites, as a result of efficient dynamical friction and late formation times of massive haloes. A large fraction of the most massive group/cluster members are accreted on to the main progenitor of the final halo as central galaxies, while about half of the galaxies with low and intermediate stellar masses are accreted as satellites. Large fractions of group and cluster galaxies (in particular those of low stellar mass) have therefore been `pre-processed' as satellites of groups with mass ˜1013 M&sun;. To quantify the relevance of hierarchical structure growth on the observed environmental trends, we have considered observational estimates of the passive galaxy fractions and their variation as a function of halo mass and clustercentric distance. Comparisons with our theoretical predictions require relatively long times (˜5-7 Gyr) for the suppression of star formation in group and cluster satellites. It is unclear how such a gentle mode of strangulation can be achieved by simply relaxing the assumption of instantaneous stripping of the hot gas reservoir associated with accreting galaxies, or if the difficulties encountered by recent galaxy formation models in reproducing the observed trends signal a more fundamental problem with the treatment of star formation and feedback in these galaxies.

AB  - Bulge-disc decomposition is a valuable tool for understanding galaxies. However, achieving robust measurements of component properties is difficult, even with high quality imaging, and it becomes even more so with the imaging typical of large surveys. In this paper we consider the advantages of a new, multi-band approach to galaxy fitting. We perform automated bulge-disc decompositions for 163 nearby galaxies, by simultaneously fitting multiple images taken in five photometric filters. We show that we are able to recover structural measurements that agree well with various other works, and confirm a number of key results. We additionally use our results to illustrate the link between total S\'ersic index and bulge-disc structure, and demonstrate that the visually classification of lenticular galaxies is strongly dependent on the inclination of their disc component. By simulating the same set of galaxies as they would appear if observed at a range of redshifts, we are able to study the behaviour of bulge-disc decompositions as data quality diminishes. We examine how our multi-band fits perform, and compare to the results of more conventional, single-band methods. Multi-band fitting improves the measurement of all parameters, but particularly the bulge-to total flux ratio and component colours. We therefore encourage the use of this approach with future surveys.

AB  - The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has completed its all-sky survey in four channels at 3.4-22 mum, detecting hundreds of millions of objects. We merge the WISE mid-infrared data with optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and provide a phenomenological characterization of WISE extragalactic sources. WISE is most sensitive at 3.4 mum (W1) and least sensitive at 22 mum (W4). The W1 band probes massive early-type galaxies out to z >~ 1. This is more distant than SDSS identified early-type galaxies, consistent with the fact that 28% of 3.4 mum sources have faint or no r-band counterparts (r > 22.2). In contrast, 92%-95% of 12 mum and 22 mum sources have SDSS optical counterparts with r <= 22.2. WISE 3.4 mum detects 89.8% of the entire SDSS QSO catalog at S/N W1 >7sigma, but only 18.9% at 22 mum with S/N W4 > 5sigma. We show that WISE colors alone are effective in isolating stars (or local early-type galaxies), star-forming galaxies, and strong active galactic nuclei (AGNs)/QSOs at z <~ 3. We highlight three major applications of WISE colors: (1) Selection of strong AGNs/QSOs at z <= 3 using W1 - W2 > 0.8 and W2 < 15.2 criteria, producing a better census of this population. The surface density of these strong AGN/QSO candidates is 67.5 $\pm$ 0.14 deg-2. (2) Selection of dust-obscured, type-2 AGN/QSO candidates. We show that WISE W1 - W2 > 0.8, W2 < 15.2 combined with r - W2 > 6 (Vega) colors can be used to identify type-2 AGN candidates. The fraction of these type-2 AGN candidates is one-third of all WISE color-selected AGNs. (3) Selection of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z ~ 2 with extremely red colors, r - W4 > 14 or well-detected 22 mum sources lacking detections in the 3.4 and 4.6 mum bands. The surface density of z ~ 2 ULIRG candidates selected with r - W4 > 14 is 0.9 $\pm$ 0.07 deg-2 at S/N W4 >= 5 (the corresponding, lowest flux density of 2.5 mJy), which is consistent with that inferred from smaller area Spitzer surveys. Optical spectroscopy of a small number of these high-redshift ULIRG candidates confirms our selection, and reveals a possible trend that optically fainter or r - W4 redder candidates are at higher redshifts.

AB  - We present an analysis of four complete samples of radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN; 3CRR, 2Jy, 6CE and 7CE) using near- and mid-IR data taken by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The combined sample consists of 79 quasars and 273 radio galaxies, and covers a redshift range 0.003 < z < 3.395. The dichotomy in the mid-IR properties of low- and high-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs and HERGs) is analysed for the first time using large complete samples. Our results demonstrate that a division in the accretion modes of LERGs and HERGs clearly stands out in the mid-IR-radio plane (L22 mum = 5 × 1043 erg s-1). This means that WISE data can be effectively used to diagnose accretion modes in radio-loud AGN. The mid-IR properties of all objects were analysed to test the unification between quasars and radio galaxies, consistent with earlier work, and we argue that smooth torus models best reproduce the observation. Quasars are found to have higher mid-IR luminosities than radio galaxies. We also studied all the sources in the near-IR to gain insights into evolution of AGN host galaxies. A relation found between the near-IR luminosity and redshift, well known in the near-IR, is apparent in the two near-IR WISE bands, supporting the idea that radio sources are hosted by massive elliptical galaxies that formed their stars at high redshifts and evolved passively thereafter. Evaluation of the positions of the sample objects in WISE colour-colour diagrams shows that widely used WISE colour cuts are not completely reliable in selecting AGN.

AB  - By exploiting the VLA-COSMOS and the Herschel-PEP surveys, we investigate the far-infrared (FIR) properties of radio-selected AGN. To this purpose, from VLA-COSMOS we considered the 1537, F1.4 GHz >= 0.06 mJy sources with a reliable redshift estimate, and sub-divided them into star-forming galaxies and AGN solely on the basis of their radio luminosity. The AGN sample is complete with respect to radio selection at all z ≲ 3.5. 832 radio sources have a counterpart in the PACS Evolutionary Probe catalogue. 175 are AGN. Their redshift distribution closely resembles that of the total radio-selected AGN population, and exhibits two marked peaks at z ˜ 0.9 and 2.5. We find that the probability for a radio-selected AGN to be detected at FIR wavelengths is both a function of radio power and redshift, whereby powerful sources are more likely to be FIR emitters at earlier epochs. This is due to two distinct effects: (1) at all radio luminosities, FIR activity monotonically increases with look-back time and (2) radio activity of AGN origin is increasingly less effective at inhibiting FIR emission. Radio-selected AGN with FIR emission are preferentially located in galaxies which are smaller than those hosting FIR-inactive sources. Furthermore, at all z ≲ 2, there seems to be a preferential (stellar) mass scale M* ˜ [1010-1011] M&sun; which maximizes the chances for FIR emission. We find such FIR (and mid-infrared) emission to be due to processes indistinguishable from those which power star-forming galaxies. It follows that radio emission in at least 35 per cent of the entire AGN population is the sum of two contributions: AGN accretion and star-forming processes within the host galaxy.

AB  - We point out a natural mechanism for quenching of star formation in early-type galaxies (ETGs). It automatically links the color of a galaxy with its morphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gas supply. Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas disks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to bound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for instance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ) using standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural occurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique. We show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient to stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an ETG red and dead while gas accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk stability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the absence of bound star-forming clumps. While other quenching mechanisms, such as gas stripping, active galactic nucleus feedback, virial shock heating, and gravitational heating are limited to massive halos, MQ can explain the appearance of red ETGs also in halos less massive than ~1012 M sun. The dense gas disks observed in some of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereas red galaxies with quenched gas disks could be more frequent at high redshift.

AB  - We use SDSS+GALEX+Galaxy Zoo data to study the quenching of star formation in low-redshift galaxies. We show that the green valley between the blue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxies in the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through which most blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. Rather, an analysis that takes morphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue early-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies are transformed from disc to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly. In contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant discs, and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates decline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these conclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a striking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms of the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that late-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of gas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion of the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental processes. In contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gas supply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapid quenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disc to spheroid. This gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger, which in most cases transforms galaxies from disc to elliptical morphology, and mergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly active galactic nuclei feedback.

AB  - Examining a sample of massive galaxies at 1.4<z<2.5 with KVega<22 from GOODS, we compare photometry from Spitzer at mid- and far-IR to submillimeter, radio, and rest-frame UV wavelengths, to test the agreement between different tracers of star formation rates (SFRs) and to explore the implications for galaxy assembly. For z~2 galaxies with moderate luminosities (L8mum<1011 Lsolar), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20%-30% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L8mum>1011 Lsolar, show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 mum-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of ~4 and ~30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z=1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively ``transparent'' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived (>~400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z>1.4 quiescent galaxies.

AB  - Aims:We study the relationship between the local environment of galaxies and their star formation rate (SFR) in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, GOODS, at z˜1.   Methods: We use ultradeep imaging at 24 mum with the MIPS camera onboard Spitzer to determine the contribution of obscured light to the SFR of galaxies over the redshift range 0.8<= z <=1.2. Accurate galaxy densities are measured thanks to the large sample of  1200 spectroscopic redshifts with high ( 70%) spectroscopic completeness. Morphology and stellar masses are derived from deep HST-ACS imaging, supplemented by ground based imaging programs and photometry from the IRAC camera onboard Spitzer.   Results: We show that the star formation-density relation observed locally was reversed at z˜ 1: the average SFR of an individual galaxy increased with local galaxy density when the universe was less than half its present age. Hierarchical galaxy formation models (simulated lightcones from the Millennium model) predicted such a reversal to occur only at earlier epochs (z>2) and at a lower level. We present a remarkable structure at z˜ 1.016, containing X-ray traced galaxy concentrations, which will eventually merge into a Virgo-like cluster. This structure illustrates how the individual SFR of galaxies increases with density and shows that it is the  1-2 Mpc scale that affects most the star formation in galaxies at z˜1. The SFR of z˜1 galaxies is found to correlate with stellar mass suggesting that mass plays a role in the observed star formation-density trend. However the specific SFR (=SFR/Mstar) decreases with stellar mass while it increases with galaxy density, which implies that the environment does directly affect the star formation activity of galaxies. Major mergers do not appear to be the unique or even major cause for this effect since nearly half (46%) of the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) at z˜ 1 present the HST-ACS morphology of spirals, while only a third present a clear signature of major mergers. The remaining galaxies are divided into compact (9%) and irregular (14%) galaxies. Moreover, the specific SFR of major mergers is only marginally stronger than that of spirals.   Conclusions: These findings constrain the influence of the growth of large-scale structures on the star formation history of galaxies. Reproducing the SFR-density relation at z˜1 is a new challenge for models, requiring a correct balance between mass assembly through mergers and in-situ star formation at early epochs.

AB  - We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass (M*) and redshift z in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey. For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 1010(1010.8) Msolar at z<0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 mum photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M* and z (1 sigma<~+/-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z>1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend ~67%(95%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of <~2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z~1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z~1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.

AB  - In April 2013, a workshop entitled "What Regulates Galaxy Evolution" was held at the Lorentz Center. The aim of the workshop was to bring together the observational and theoretical community working on galaxy evolution, and to discuss in depth of the current problems in the subject, as well as to review the most recent observational constraints. A total of 42 astrophysicists attended the workshop. A significant fraction of the time was devoted to identifying the most interesting "open questions" in the field, and to discuss how progress can be made. This review discusses the four questions (one for each day of the workshop) that, in our opinion, were the focus of the most intense debate. We present each question in its context, and close with a discussion of what future directions should be pursued in order to make progress on these problems.

AB  - We estimate the galaxy density along lines of sight to hard extragalactic gamma-ray sources by correlating source positions on the sky with a void catalog based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Extragalactic gamma-ray sources that are detected at very high energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) or have been highlighted as VHE-emitting candidates in the Fermi Large Area Telescope hard source catalog (together referred to as "VHE-like" sources) are distributed along underdense lines of sight at the 2.4 sigma level. There is also a less suggestive correlation for the Fermi hard source population (1.7 sigma). A correlation between 10-500 GeV flux and underdense fraction along the line of sight for VHE-like and Fermi hard sources is found at 2.4 sigma and 2.6 sigma, respectively. The preference for underdense sight lines is not displayed by gamma-ray emitting galaxies within the second Fermi catalog, containing sources detected above 100 MeV, or the SDSS DR7 quasar catalog. We investigate whether this marginal correlation might be a result of lower extragalactic background light (EBL) photon density within the underdense regions and find that, even in the most extreme case of a entirely underdense sight line, the EBL photon density is only 2% less than the nominal EBL density. Translating this into gamma-ray attenuation along the line of sight for a highly attenuated source with opacity tau(E,z) ~5, we estimate that the attentuation of gamma-rays decreases no more than 10%. This decrease, although non-neglible, is unable to account for the apparent hard source correlation with underdense lines of sight.

AB  - BL Lac objects are active nuclei, hosted in massive elliptical galaxies, the emission of which is dominated by a relativistic jet closely aligned with the line of sight. This implies the existence of a parent population of sources with a misaligned jet, that have been identi?ed with low-power radiogalaxies. The spectrum of BL Lacs, dominated by non-thermal emission over the whole electromagnetic range, together with bright compact radio cores, high luminosities, rapid and large amplitude flux variability at all frequencies and strong polarization make these sources an optimal laboratory for high energy astrophysics. A most distinctive characteristic of the class is the weakness or absence of spectral lines, that historically hindered the identi?fication of their nature and ever thereafter proved to be a hurdle in the determination of their distance. In this paper we review the main observational facts that contribute to the present basic interpretation of this class of active galaxies. We overview the history of the BL Lac objects research fi?eld and their population as it emerged from multi-wavelength surveys. The properties of the flux variability and polarization, compared with those at radio, X-ray and gamma-ray frequencies, are summarized together with the present knowledge of the host galaxies, their environments, and central black hole masses. We focus this review on the optical observations, that played a crucial role in the early phase of BL Lacs studies, and, in spite of extensive radio, X-ray, and recently gamma-ray observations, could represent the future major contribution to the unveiling of the origin of these sources. In particular they could provide a fi?rm conclusion on the long debated issue of the cosmic evolution of this class of active galactic nuclei and on the connection between formation of supermassive black holes and relativistic jets.

AB  - We present an estimate of the galaxy stellar mass function and its division by morphological type in the local (0.025 < z < 0.06) Universe. Adopting robust morphological classifications as previously presented (Kelvin et al.) for a sample of 3,727 galaxies taken from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey, we define a local volume and stellar mass limited sub-sample of 2,711 galaxies to a lower stellar mass limit of M = 10^9.0 M_sun. We confirm that the galaxy stellar mass function is well described by a double Schechter function given by M* = 10^10.64 M_sun, \alpha1 = -0.43, \phi*1 = 4.18 dex^-1 Mpc^-3, \alpha2 = -1.50 and \phi*2 = 0.74 dex^-1 Mpc^-3. The constituent morphological-type stellar mass functions are well sampled above our lower stellar mass limit, excepting the faint little blue spheroid population of galaxies. We find approximately 71+3-4% of the stellar mass in the local Universe is found within spheroid dominated galaxies; ellipticals and S0-Sas. The remaining 29+4-3% falls predominantly within late type disk dominated systems, Sab-Scds and Sd-Irrs. Adopting reasonable bulge-to-total ratios implies that approximately half the stellar mass today resides in spheroidal structures, and half in disk structures. Within this local sample, we find approximate stellar mass proportions for E : S0-Sa : Sab-Scd : Sd-Irr of 34 : 37 : 24 : 5.

AB  - The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mapped the entire sky at mid-infrared wavelengths 3.4 mum, 4.6 mum, 12 mum, and 22 mum. The mission was primarily designed to extract point sources, leaving resolved and extended sources, for the most part, unexplored. Accordingly, we have begun a dedicated WISE Enhanced Resolution Galaxy Atlas (WERGA) project to fully characterize large, nearby galaxies and produce a legacy image atlas and source catalog. Here we demonstrate the first results of the WERGA project for a sample of 17 galaxies, chosen to be of large angular size, diverse morphology, and covering a range in color, stellar mass, and star formation. It includes many well-studied galaxies, such as M 51, M 81, M 87, M 83, M 101, and IC 342. Photometry and surface brightness decomposition is carried out after special super-resolution processing, achieving spatial resolutions similar to that of Spitzer Infrared Array Camera. The enhanced resolution method is summarized in the first paper of this two-part series. In this second work, we present WISE, Spitzer, and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) photometric and characterization measurements for the sample galaxies, combining the measurements to study the global properties. We derive star formation rates using the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon sensitive 12 mum (W3) fluxes, warm-dust sensitive 22 mum (W4) fluxes, and young massive-star sensitive ultraviolet (UV) fluxes. Stellar masses are estimated using the 3.4 mum (W1) and 4.6 mum (W2) measurements that trace the dominant stellar mass content. We highlight and showcase the detailed results of M 83, comparing the WISE/Spitzer results with the Australia Telescope Compact Array H I gas distribution and GALEX UV emission, tracing the evolution from gas to stars. In addition to the enhanced images, WISE's all-sky coverage provides a tremendous advantage over Spitzer for building a complete nearby galaxy catalog, tracing both stellar mass and star formation histories. We discuss the construction of a complete mid-infrared catalog of galaxies and its complementary role of studying the assembly and evolution of galaxies in the local universe.

AB  - We present evidence that bona fide disks and starburst systems occupy distinct regions in the gas mass versus star formation rate (SFR) plane, both for the integrated quantities and for the respective surface densities. This result is based on carbon monoxide (CO) observations of galaxy populations at low and high redshifts, and on the current consensus for the CO luminosity to gas mass conversion factors. The data suggest the existence of two different SF regimes: a long-lasting mode for disks and a more rapid mode for starbursts, the latter probably occurring during major mergers or in dense nuclear SF regions. Both modes are observable over a large range of SFRs. The detection of CO emission from distant near-IR selected galaxies reveals such bimodal behavior for the first time, as they allow us to probe gas in disk galaxies with much higher SFRs than are seen locally. The different regimes can potentially be interpreted as the effect of a top-heavy initial mass function in starbursts. However, we favor a different physical origin related to the fraction of molecular gas in dense clouds. The IR luminosity to gas mass ratio (i.e., the SF efficiency) appears to be inversely proportional to the dynamical (rotation) timescale. Only when accounting for the dynamical timescale, a universal SF law is obtained, suggesting a direct link between global galaxy properties and the local SFR.

AB  - We explore using our continuity approach the underlying connections between the evolution of the faint-end slope of the stellar mass function of star-forming galaxies, the logarithmic slope of the sSFR-mass relation and the merging of galaxies. We derive analytically the consequences of the observed constancy of the faint-end slope since redshifts of at least z ~ 2. If the logarithmic slope of the sSFR-mass relation is negative, then the faint-end slope should quickly diverge due to the differential mass increase of galaxies on the star-forming main sequence, and this will also quickly destroy the Schechter form of the mass function. This problem can be solved by removing low mass galaxies by merging them into more massive galaxies. We quantify this process by introducing the specific merger mass rate (sMMR) as the specific rate of mass added to a given galaxy through mergers. For a modest negative value of the logarithmic slope of the sSFR-mass relation of beta ~ -0.1, an average sMMR ~ 0.1sSFR across the population is required to keep the faint-end slope constant with epoch, as observed. This in turn implies a merger rate of ~ 0.2sSFR for major mergers, which is consistent with the available observational estimates. More negative values of beta require higher sMMR and higher merger rates, and the steepening of the mass function becomes impossible to control for beta < ~ -0.6, for an observed value of the faint-end slope of ~ -1.4. The close link that is required between the in situ sSFR and the sMMR probably arises because both are closely linked to the buildup of dark matter haloes. These new findings further develop the formalism for the evolving galaxy population that we introduced earlier, and show how striking symmetries in the galaxy population can emerge as the result of deep links between the physical processes involved.

AB  - We investigate the effect of metallicity calibrations, AGN classification, and aperture covering fraction on the local mass-metallicity (M-Z) relation using 27,730 star-forming galaxies from the SDSS Data Release 4. We analyze the SDSS M-Z relation with 10 metallicity calibrations, including theoretical and empirical methods. We show that the choice of metallicity calibration has a significant effect on the shape and y-intercept [12+log(O/H)] of the M-Z relation. The absolute metallicity scale (y-intercept) varies up to Delta[log(O/H)]=0.7 dex, depending on the calibration used, and the change in shape is substantial. These results indicate that it is critical to use the same metallicity calibration when comparing different luminosity-metallicity or M-Z relations. We present new metallicity conversions that allow metallicities that have been derived using different strong-line calibrations to be converted to the same base calibration. These conversions facilitate comparisons between different samples, particularly comparisons between galaxies at different redshifts for which different suites of emission lines are available. Our new conversions successfully remove the large 0.7 dex discrepancies between the metallicity calibrations, and we reach agreement in the M-Z relation to within 0.03 dex on average. We investigate the effect of AGN classification and aperture covering fraction on the M-Z relation. We find that different AGN classification methods have negligible effect on the SDSS M-Z relation. We compare the SDSS M-Z relation with nuclear and global relations from the NFGS. The turnover of the M-Z relation at M*~1010 Msolar depends on the aperture covering fraction. We find that a lower redshift limit of z<0.04 is insufficient for avoiding aperture effects in fiber spectra of the highest stellar mass (M*>1010 Msolar) galaxies.

AB  - We study the environments of low-redshift (z < 0.5) quasars based on a large and homogeneous data set from the Stripe 82 region of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We have compared the <1 Mpc scale environments of 302 quasars that were resolved in our recent study to those of 288 inactive galaxies with closely matched redshifts. Crucially, the luminosities of the inactive galaxies and the quasar host galaxies are also closely matched, unlike in most previous studies. The environmental overdensities were studied by measuring the number density of galaxies within a projected distance of 200 kpc to 1 Mpc. The galaxy number density of the quasar environments is comparable to that of the inactive galaxies with similar luminosities, both classes of objects showing significant excess compared to the background galaxy density for distances <400 kpc. There is no significant dependence of the galaxy number density on redshift, quasar or host galaxy luminosity, black hole mass or radio loudness. This suggests that the fuelling and triggering of the nuclear activity is only weakly dependent on the local environment of quasars, and the quasar phase may be a short-lived common phase in the life cycle of all massive galaxies.

AB  - We investigate the (large-scale) bar fraction in a mass-complete sample of M > 1010.5 Msolar disc galaxies at 0.2 < z < 0.6 in the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. The fraction of barred discs strongly depends on mass, disc morphology and specific star formation rate (SSFR). At intermediate stellar mass (1010.5 < M < 1011 Msolar) the bar fraction in early-type discs is much higher, at all redshifts, by a factor of ~2, than that in late-type discs. This trend is reversed at higher stellar mass (M > 1011 Msolar), where the fraction of bars in early-type discs becomes significantly lower, at all redshifts, than that in late-type discs. The bar fractions for galaxies with low and high SSFRs closely follow those of the morphologically selected early- and late-type populations, respectively. This indicates a close correspondence between morphology and SSFR in disc galaxies at these earlier epochs. Interestingly, the total bar fraction in 1010.5 < M < 1011 Msolar discs is built up by a factor of ~2 over the redshift interval explored, while for M > 1011 Msolar discs it remains roughly constant. This indicates that, already by z ~ 0.6, spectral and morphological transformations in the most massive disc galaxies have largely converged to the familiar Hubble sequence that we observe in the local Universe, while for intermediate-mass discs this convergence is ongoing until at least z ~ 0.2. Moreover, these results highlight the importance of employing mass-limited samples for quantifying the evolution of barred galaxies. Finally, the evolution of the barred galaxy populations investigated does not depend on the large-scale environmental density (at least, on the scales which can be probed with the available photometric redshifts).

AB  - We investigate the effect of active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability on the observed connection between star formation and black hole accretion in extragalactic surveys. Recent studies have reported relatively weak correlations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of AGN hosts, which has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between AGN activity and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary significantly on a wide range of timescales (from hours to Myr) that are far shorter than the typical timescale for star formation (gsim100 Myr). This variability can have important consequences for observed correlations. We present a simple model in which all star-forming galaxies host an AGN when averaged over ~100 Myr timescales, with long-term average AGN accretion rates that are perfectly correlated with the star formation rate (SFR). We show that reasonable prescriptions for AGN variability reproduce the observed weak correlations between SFR and L AGN in typical AGN host galaxies, as well as the general trends in the observed AGN luminosity functions, merger fractions, and measurements of the average AGN luminosity as a function of SFR. These results imply that there may be a tight connection between AGN activity and SFR over galaxy evolution timescales, and that the apparent similarities in rest-frame colors, merger rates, and clustering of AGNs compared to "inactive" galaxies may be due primarily to AGN variability. The results provide motivation for future deep, wide extragalactic surveys that can measure the distribution of AGN accretion rates as a function of SFR.

AB  - We present the results of a high resolution (0.27'' px(-1) ) near-infrared H band (1.65 mum) imaging survey of a complete sample of 20 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) extracted from the 2Jy catalogue of radio sources (Wall & Peacock 1985). The observed objects are intrinsically luminous with median M(B) =3D -25.5. The median redshift of the objects in the sample is z =3D 0.65. At this redshift, the H band observations probe the old stellar population of the hosts at rest frame wavelength of sim1 mum. We are able to detect the host galaxy clearly for six (30 %) FSRQs and marginally for six (30 %) other FSRQs, while the object remains unresolved for eight (40 %) cases. We find the galaxies hosting FSRQs to be very luminous (M(H)sim-27). Compared with the typical galaxy luminosity L* (M*(H)sim-25) they appear sim2 mag brighter, although the undetected hosts may reduce this difference. They are also at least as bright as, and probably by sim1 mag brighter than, the brightest cluster galaxies (M(H)sim-26). The luminosities of the FSRQ hosts are intermediate between host galaxies of low redshift radio-loud quasars and BL Lac objects (M(H)sim-26), and the hosts of high redshift radio-loud quasars (M(H)sim-29), in good agreement with current unified models for radio-loud AGN, taking into account stellar evolution in the elliptical host galaxies. Finally, we find an indicative trend between the host and nuclear luminosity for the most luminous FSRQs, supporting the suggestion based on studies of lower redshift AGN, that there is a minimum host galaxy luminosity which increases linearly with the quasar luminosity.

AB  - The periodic orbits in a barred galaxy model potential are studied, with emphasis placed on the families that are relevant to the gas flow within the bar. This model has four free parameters, namely, its central concentration and the axial ratio, quadrupole moment, and pattern speed of its bar. The existence and extent of the families x2 and x3 are examined for realistic values of the free parameters of the model, and two different definitions of the inner Lindblad resonance in strong bar models are compared. The types of the 4/1 gap and the radii and stability of the Lagrangian points are presented as a function of the same parameters. In the central parts of the galaxy the orbits of the x1 family are nearly circular. Their axial ratio increases with the size of the orbit, to reach a maximum value between 2 and 8, and then drops. The influence of the free parameters of the model on the position and value of the maximum is also examined.

AB  - The flow of gas in and around the bars or ovals of modeled barred galaxies is studied, and it is shown that it is intimately linked to the properties of the periodic orbits. Simulations show that the density of the gas in and around the bar region is slow, except for the center and two narrow lanes which are the loci of shocks. Such shocks form if the x1 periodic orbits have either loops or large curvature values at their apocenters. The form of the shock loci depends on the number of parameters characterizing the bar and disk potential. In order for shocks to be offset from the bar major axis toward its leading side, the x2 and x3 families must not only exist but also cover a sufficient extent along the bar major axis. The existence of offset shock loci of the observed shape puts strict constraints on the values the various model parameters may take. For low values of the bar axial ratio or the bar quadrupole moment the shock loci are curved, with their concave sides towards the bar major axis. Substantial inflow is found in models with strong shocks.

AB  - We present a determination of the effects of including galaxy morphological parameters in photometric redshift estimation with an artificial neural network method. Neural networks, which recognize patterns in the information content of data in an unbiased way, can be a useful estimator of the additional information contained in extra parameters, such as those describing morphology, if the input data are treated on an equal footing. We use imaging and five band photometric magnitudes from the All-wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey (AEGIS). It is shown that certain principal components of the morphology information are correlated with galaxy type. However, we find that for the data used the inclusion of morphological information does not have a statistically significant benefit for photometric redshift estimation with the techniques employed here. The inclusion of these parameters may result in a tradeoff between extra information and additional noise, with the additional noise becoming more dominant as more parameters are added.

AB  - [abridged] New near-infrared surveys, using the HST, offer an unprecedented opportunity to study rest-frame optical galaxy morphologies at z>1 and to calibrate automated morphological parameters that will play a key role in classifying future massive datasets like EUCLID or LSST. We study automated parameters (e.g. CAS, Gini, M20) of massive galaxies at 1<z<3, measure their dependence on wavelength and evolution with redshift and quantify the reliability of these parameters in discriminating between visually-determined morphologies, using machine learning algorithms. We find that the relative trends between morphological types observed in the low-redshift literature are preserved at z>1: bulge-dominated systems have systematically higher concentration and Gini coefficients and are less asymmetric and rounder than disk-dominated galaxies. However, at z>1, galaxies are, on average, 50% more asymmetric and have Gini and M20 values that are 10% higher and 20% lower respectively. In bulge-dominated galaxies, morphological parameters derived from the rest-frame UV and optical wavelengths are well correlated; however late-type galaxies exhibit higher asymmetry and clumpiness when measured in the rest-frame UV. We find that broad morphological classes (e.g. bulge vs. disk dominated) can be distinguished using parameters with high (80%) purity and completeness of 80%. In a similar vein, irregular disks and mergers can also be distinguished from bulges and regular disks with a contamination lower than 20%. However, mergers cannot be differentiated from the irregular morphological class using these parameters, due to increasingly asymmetry of non-interacting late-type galaxies at z>1. Our automated procedure is applied to the CANDELS GOODS-S field and compared with the visual classification recently released on the same area getting similar results.

AB  - We describe an image analysis supervised learning algorithm that can automatically classify galaxy images. The algorithm is first trained using manually classified images of elliptical, spiral and edge-on galaxies. A large set of image features is extracted from each image, and the most informative features are selected using Fisher scores. Test images can then be classified using a simple Weighted Nearest Neighbour rule such that the Fisher scores are used as the feature weights. Experimental results show that galaxy images from Galaxy Zoo can be classified automatically to spiral, elliptical and edge-on galaxies with an accuracy of ~90 per cent compared to classifications carried out by the author. Full compilable source code of the algorithm is available for free download, and its general-purpose nature makes it suitable for other uses that involve automatic image analysis of celestial objects.

AB  - Testing theories of hierarchical structure formation requires estimating the distribution of galaxy morphologies and its change with redshift. One aspect of this investigation involves identifying galaxies with disturbed morphologies (e.g. merging galaxies). This is often done by summarizing galaxy images using, e.g. the concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness and Gini-M20 statistics of Conselice and Lotz et al., respectively, and associating particular statistic values with disturbance. We introduce three statistics that enhance detection of disturbed morphologies at high redshift (z ˜ 2): the multimode (M), intensity (I) and deviation (D) statistics. We show their effectiveness by training a machine-learning classifier, random forest, using 1639 galaxies observed in the H band by the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3, galaxies that had been previously classified by eye by the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey collaboration. We find that the MID statistics (and the A statistic of Conselice) are the most useful for identifying disturbed morphologies.  We also explore whether human annotators are useful for identifying disturbed morphologies. We demonstrate that they show limited ability to detect disturbance at high redshift, and that increasing their number beyond ≈10 does not provably yield better classification performance. We propose a simulation-based model-fitting algorithm that mitigates these issues by bypassing annotation.

AB  - The large number of galaxies imaged by digital sky surveys reinforces the need for computational methods for analyzing galaxy morphology. While the morphology of most galaxies can be associated with a stage on the Hubble sequence, the morphology of galaxy mergers is far more complex due to the combination of two or more galaxies with different morphologies and the interaction between them. Here we propose a computational method based on unsupervised machine learning that can quantitatively analyze morphologies of galaxy mergers and associate galaxies by their morphology. The method works by first generating multiple synthetic galaxy models for each galaxy merger, and then extracting a large set of numerical image content descriptors for each galaxy model. These numbers are weighted using Fisher discriminant scores, and then the similarities between the galaxy mergers are deduced using a variation of Weighted Nearest Neighbor analysis such that the Fisher scores are used as weights. The similarities between the galaxy mergers are visualized using phylogenies to provide a graph that reflects the morphological similarities between the different galaxy mergers, and thus quantitatively profile the morphology of galaxy mergers.

AB  - The presence of a well-defined and narrow dust lane in an edge-on spiral galaxy is the observational signature of a thin and dense molecular disk, in which gravitational collapse has overcome turbulence. Using a sample of galaxies out to z ~ 1 extracted from the COSMOS survey, we identify the fraction of massive (L* V ) disks that display a dust lane. Our goal is to explore the evolution in the stability of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) disks in spiral galaxies over a cosmic timescale. We check the reliability of our morphological classifications against changes in rest-frame wavelength, resolution, and cosmic dimming with (artificially redshifted) images of local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the fraction of L* V  disks with dust lanes in COSMOS is consistent with the local fraction (≈80%) out to z ~ 0.7. At z = 0.8, the dust lane fraction is only slightly lower. A somewhat lower dust lane fraction in starbursting galaxies tentatively supports the notion that a high specific star formation rate can efficiently destroy or inhibit a dense molecular disk. A small subsample of higher redshift COSMOS galaxies display low internal reddening (E[B - V]), as well as a low incidence of dust lanes. These may be disks in which the growth of the dusty ISM disk lags behind that of the stellar disk. We note that at z = 0.8, the most massive galaxies display a lower dust lane fraction than lower mass galaxies. A small contribution of recent mergers or starbursts to this most massive population may be responsible. The fact that the fraction of galaxies with dust lanes in COSMOS is consistent with little or no evolution implies that models to explain the spectral energy distribution or the host galaxy dust extinction of supernovae based on local galaxies are still applicable to higher redshift spirals. It also suggests that dust lanes are long-lived phenomena or can be reformed over very short timescales.

AB  - From a survey of edge-on disks, we find that disk galaxies show a sharp, mass-dependent transition in the structure of their dusty ISM. In more massive, rapidly rotating disks with Vc>120kms-1, we see the well-defined dust lanes traditionally associated with edge-on galaxies. However, in more slowly rotating, lower mass galaxies with Vc<120kms-1, we find no dust lanes. Instead, the distribution of dust in these galaxies has a much larger scale height and thus appears more diffuse. Evidence suggests that the change in scale height is due primarily to changes in the turbulent velocities supporting the gas layer rather than to sharp changes in the gas surface density. A detailed analysis of our sample reveals that the decrease in the dust scale height is associated with the onset of disk instabilities, evaluated for a mixed star+gas disk. Specifically, we find that all of the high-mass galaxies with dust lanes are gravitationally unstable and thus are prone to fragmentation and gravitational collapse along spiral arms. Empirically, our data imply that turbulence has lower characteristic velocities in the presence of disk instabilities, leading to smaller gas scale heights and the appearance of narrow dust lanes. The drop in velocity dispersion may be due either to a switch in the driving mechanism for turbulence from supernovae to gravitational instabilities or to a change in the response of the ISM to supernovae after the ISM has collapsed to a dense layer. We hypothesize that the drop in gas scale height may lead to significant increases in the star formation rate when disk instabilities are present. First, the collapse of the gas layer increases the typical gas density, reducing the star formation timescale. Second, the star formation efficiency increases because of lower turbulent velocities. These two effects can combine to produce a sharp increase in the star formation rate with little change in the gas surface density and may therefore provide an explanation for the Kennicutt surface density threshold for star formation. Our data also suggest that star formation will be systematically less efficient in low-mass disks with Vc<120kms-1, since these galaxies are stable and lie entirely below the Kennicutt surface density threshold. In these stable systems the effective nucleosynthetic yield is reduced because the star formation timescale becomes longer than the gas accretion timescale, suppressing the metallicity. This effect can possibly produce the observed fall-off in metallicity at rotation speeds Vc<120kms-1. Thus, infall provides an equally plausible explanation of the mass-metallicity relation in disks as global outflows driven by supernova winds. The transitions in disk stability, dust structure, and/or star formation efficiency may also be responsible for the observed changes in the slope of the Tully-Fisher relation, in the sharp increase in the thickness of low-mass galaxy disks, and in the onset of bulges in galaxies with Vc>~120kms-1. The latter observation lends support to theories in which bulges in late-type galaxies grow through secular evolution in response to disk instabilities. We include in this paper relationships between the surface density and the vertical stellar velocity dispersion as a function of galaxy rotation speed, which may be useful constraints on galaxy formation models.

AB  - We present the first report on an innovative new project named "RAD@home", a citizen-science research collaboratory built on free web-services like Facebook, Google, Skype, NASA Skyview, NED, TGSS etc.. This is the first of its kind in India, a zero-funded, zero-infrastructure, human-resource network to educate and directly involve in research, hundreds of science-educated under-graduate population of India, irrespective of their official employment and home-location with in the country. Professional international collaborators are involved in follow up observation and publication of the objects discovered by the collaboratory. We present here ten newly found candidate episodic radio galaxies, already proposed to GMRT, and ten more interesting cases which includes, bent-lobe radio galaxies located in new Mpc-scale filaments, likely tracing cosmological cluster accretion from the cosmic web. Two new Speca-like rare spiral-host large radio galaxies have also been been reported here. Early analyses from our follow up observations with the Subaru and XMM-Newton telescopes have revealed that Speca is likely a new entry to the cluster and is a fast rotating, extremely massive, star forming disk galaxy. Speca-like massive galaxies with giant radio lobes, are possibly remnants of luminous quasars in the early Universe or of first supermassive black holes with in first masssve galaxies. As discoveries of Speca-like galaxies did not require new data from big telescopes, but free archival radio-optical data, these early results demonstrate the discovery potential of RAD@home and how it can help resource-rich professionals, as well as demonstrate a model of academic-growth for resource-poor people in the underdeveloped regions via Internet.

AB  - We studied a background dwarf nova of KIC 11412044 in the Kepler public data and identified it with GALEX J194419.33+491257.0. This object turned out to be a very active SU UMa-type dwarf nova that has a mean supercycle of ˜ 150 d and frequent normal outbursts with intervals of 4-10 d. The object showed a strong persistent signal of the orbital variation with a period of 0.0528164(4) d (76.06 min) and superhumps with a typical period of 0.0548 d during its superoutbursts. Most of the superoutbursts were accompanied by a precursor outburst. All these features are unusual for this very short orbital period. We succeeded in detecting an evolving stage of superhumps (stage A superhumps) and obtained a mass ratio of 0.141(2), which is unusually high for this orbital period. We suggest that the unusual outburst properties are a result of this high mass ratio. We suspect that this object is a member of the recently recognized class of cataclysmic variables (CVs) with a stripped core evolved secondary which are evolving toward AM CVn-type CVs. The present determination of the mass ratio by using stage A superhumps is the first case in such systems.

AB  - We present our latest results on the connection between accretion rate and relativistic jet power in AGN, by using a large sample which includes mostly blazars, but contains also some radio-galaxies. The jet power can be traced by gamma-ray luminosity in the case of blazars, and radio luminosity for both classes. The accretion disc luminosity is instead traced by the broad emission lines. Among blazars, we find a correlation between broad line emission and the gamma-ray or radio luminosities, suggesting a direct tight connection between jet power and accretion rate. We confirm that the observational differences between blazar subclasses reflect differences in the accretion regime, but with blazars only we cannot properly access the low-accretion regime. By introducing radio-galaxies, we succeed in observing the fingerprint of the transition between radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion discs in the jetted AGN family. The transition occurs at the standard critical value $L_\rm d/L_\rm Edd\sim10^-2$ and it appears smooth. Below this value, the ionizing luminosity emitted by the accretion structure drops significantly.

AB  - We present an overview of galaxy evolution across cosmic time in the Illustris Simulation. Illustris is an N-body/hydrodynamical simulation that evolves 2*1820^3 resolution elements in a (106.5Mpc)^3 box from cosmological initial conditions down to z=0 using the AREPO moving-mesh code. The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z=0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star-formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z=7 to z=0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z=4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their halos for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star-formation rates up to z=8. In addition, we (i) present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z=5 to z=0, for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance in HST mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies selected at z=2 to their z=0 descendants, and quantify their growth and merger histories, and (iii) track massive z=0 galaxies to high redshift and study their joint evolution in star-formation activity and compactness. We conclude with a discussion of several disagreements with observations, and lay out possible directions for future research.

AB  - We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of $(106.5\rm Mpc)^3$, has a dark mass resolution of $6.26 \times 10^6\rm M_\odot$, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of $1.26 \times 10^6\rm M_\odot$. At $z=0$ gravitational forces are softened on scales of $710\rm pc$, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of $48\rm pc$. We follow the dynamical evolution of $2\times 1820^3$ resolution elements and in addition passively evolve $1820^3$ Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than $18$ billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. At $z=0$ our simulation volume contains about $40,000$ well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at $z=0$. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disk galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.

AB  - By considering the interaction of a single stellar orbit with a weak cos 2 phi potential it is shown that in the central regions of galaxies with slowly rising rotation curves, the elongations of the orbits will align along any potential valley and oscillate about it. This effect is more pronounced for elongated orbits. In such regions any pair of orbits will naturally align under their mutual gravity, and so a bar will form. The gravity of this bar will drive a spiral structure in the outer parts of the galaxy, where differential rotation is too strong to allow the orbits to be caught by the bar. The spiral structure carries a torque that slowly drains angular momentum from the bar, gradually making its outline more eccentric and slowing its pattern speed. In the outer parts of the bar only the more eccentric orbits align with the potential valley; the rounder ones form a ring or lens about the bar. As the pattern speed slows down, the corotation resonance and outer Lindblad resonance, which receive the angular momentum, move outwards.

AB  - Isolated barred galaxies evolve by redistributing their angular momentum, which, emitted by material in the inner disc at resonance with the bar, can be absorbed by resonant material in the outer disc, or in the halo. The amount of angular momentum that can be emitted/absorbed at a given resonance depends on the distribution function of the emitting/absorbing material. It thus depends not only on the amount of material on resonant orbits, but also on the velocity dispersion of that material. As it loses angular momentum, the bar becomes stronger and it also rotates slower. Thus the strength of the bar and the decrease of its pattern speed with time are set by the amount of angular momentum exchanged within the galaxy, which, in turn, is regulated by the mass distribution and the velocity dispersion of the material in the disc and spheroidal components. Correlations between the pattern speed of the bar, its strength and the angular momentum absorbed by the spheroid (halo plus bulge) argue strongly that it is the amount of angular momentum exchanged that determines the strength and the slowdown rate of the bar. The decrease of the bar pattern speed with time should not be used to set constraints on the halo-to-disc mass ratio, since it depends also on the velocity dispersion of the halo and disc material.

AB  - We present an analysis of the host properties of 85 224 emission-line galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that Seyferts and low-ionization narrow emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus-HII (AGN-HII) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [OIII] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [OIII] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[OIII]/sigma4, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixed L[OIII]/sigma4, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/LEDD and Seyferts dominant at high L/LEDD. These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than required by Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.

AB  - Previous simulations of the growth of cosmic structures have broadly reproduced the 'cosmic web' of galaxies that we see in the Universe, but failed to create a mixed population of elliptical and spiral galaxies due to numerical inaccuracies and incomplete physical models. Moreover, because of computational constraints, they were unable to track the small scale evolution of gas and stars to the present epoch within a representative portion of the Universe. Here we report a simulation that starts 12 million years after the Big Bang, and traces 13 billion years of cosmic evolution with 12 billion resolution elements in a volume of $(106.5\rm Mpc)^3$. It yields a reasonable population of ellipticals and spirals, reproduces the distribution of galaxies in clusters and statistics of hydrogen on large scales, and at the same time the metal and hydrogen content of galaxies on small scales.

AB  - We report the discovery of bent double jets in the elliptical galaxy NGC 1272, a member of the Perseus cluster. The jets have a radius of curvature of ~2 kpc, much smaller than the galaxy half-light radius of ~11 kpc. This bending is likely a result of ram pressure, and indicates that the intracluster gas enters deep within the galaxy and that the interstellar medium of NGC 1272 has been significantly removed. X-ray observations of the surrounding intracluster medium allow us to constrain the pressure within the jet. We find that the standard assumptions of equipartition often used in interpreting other jets underestimate the pressure in the jets by a factor ~30.

AB  - The relation of central black hole mass and stellar spheroid velocity dispersion (the M-$\sigma$ relation) is one of the best-known and tightest correlations linking black holes and their host galaxies. There has been much scrutiny concerning the difficulty of obtaining accurate black hole measurements, and rightly so; however, it has been taken for granted that measurements of velocity dispersion are essentially straightforward. We examine five disk galaxies from cosmological SPH simulations and find that line-of-sight effects due to galaxy orientation can affect the measured $\sigma$ by 30%, and consequently black hole mass predictions by up to 1.0 dex. Face-on orientations correspond to systematically lower velocity dispersion measurements, while more edge-on orientations give higher velocity dispersions, due to contamination by disk stars when measuring line of sight quantities. We caution observers that the uncertainty of velocity dispersion measurements is at least 20 km/s, and can be much larger for moderate inclinations. This effect may account for some of the scatter in the locally measured M-$\sigma$ relation, particularly at the low-mass end.

AB  - A new physical framework for the emergence of the Hubble sequence is outlined, based on novel analyses performed to quantify the evolution of cold streams of a large sample of galaxies from a state-of-the-art ultra-high resolution, large-scale adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic simulation in a fully cosmological setting. It is found that the following three key physical variables of galactic cold inflows crossing the virial sphere substantially decrease with decreasing redshift: the number of streams N_90 that make up 90% of concurrent inflow mass flux, average inflow rate per stream dot M_90 and mean (mass flux weighted) gas density in the streams n_gas. Another key variable, the stream dimensionless angular momentum parameter lambda, instead is found to increase with decreasing redshift. Assimilating these trends and others leads naturally to a physically coherent scenario for the emergence of the Hubble sequence, including the following expectations: (1) the predominance of a mixture of disproportionately small irregular and complex disk galaxies at z>2 when most galaxies have multiple concurrent streams, (2) the beginning of the appearance of flocculent spirals at z~1-2 when the number of concurrent streams are about 2-3, (3) the grand-design spiral galaxies appear at z<1 when galaxies with only one major cold stream significantly emerge. These expected general trends are in good accord with observations. Early type galaxies are those that have entered a perennial state of zero cold gas stream, with their abundance increasing with decreasing redshift.

AB  - One of the key parameters that characterize spiral arms in disk galaxies is a pitch angle that measures the inclination of a spiral arm to the direction of galactic rotation. The pitch angle differs from galaxy to galaxy, which suggests that the rotation law of galactic disks determines it. In order to investigate the relation between the pitch angle of spiral arms and the shear rate of galactic differential rotation, we perform local $N$-body simulations of pure stellar disks. We find that the pitch angle increases with the epicycle frequency and decreases with the shear rate and obtain the fitting formula. This dependence is explained by the swing amplification mechanism.

AB  - Aims: We present an analysis of the star formation properties of field galaxies within the local volume out to a recession velocity limit of 3000 km s-1.  Methods: A parent sample of 863 star-forming galaxies is used to calculate a B-band luminosity function. This is then populated with star formation information from a subsample of 327 galaxies, for which we have Halpha imaging, firstly by calibrating a relationship between galaxy B-band luminosity and star formation rate, and secondly by a Monte Carlo simulation of a representative sample of galaxies, in which star formation information is randomly sampled from the observed subset.  Results: The total star formation rate density of the local Universe is found to be between 0.016 and 0.023 M&sun; yr-1 Mpc-3 with the uncertainties dominated by the internal extinction correction used in converting measured Halpha fluxes to star formation rates. If our internally derived B-band luminosity function is replaced by one from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey blue sequence, the star formation rate densities are ~60% of the above values. We also calculate the contribution to the total star formation rate density from galaxies of different luminosities and Hubble T-types. The largest contribution comes from bright galaxies with MB˜ -20 mag, and the total contribution from galaxies fainter than MB= -15.5 mag is less than 10%. Almost 60% of the star formation rate density comes from galaxies of types Sb, Sbc or Sc; 9% from galaxies earlier than Sb and 33% from galaxies later than Sc. Finally, 75-80% of the total star formation in the local Universe is shown to be occurring in disk regions, defined as being >1 kpc from the centres of galaxies. Conclusions: The star formation rate density estimates found here are consistent with values from the recent literature using a range of different star formation indicators. Even though they are numerous, dwarf galaxies contribute little to the star formation in the local Universe, and the bulk of the star formation takes place in L* spirals.  Based on observations made with the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope operated on the island of La Palma by the Isaac Newton Group in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias.

AB  - We present an integrated framework for using Convolutional Networks for classification, localization and detection. We show how a multiscale and sliding window approach can be efficiently implemented within a ConvNet. We also introduce a novel deep learning approach to localization by learning to predict object boundaries. Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks. In post-competition work, we establish a new state of the art for the detection task. Finally, we release a feature extractor from our best model called OverFeat.

AB  - We introduce a simple and effective method for regularizing large convolutional neural networks. We replace the conventional deterministic pooling operations with a stochastic procedure, randomly picking the activation within each pooling region according to a multinomial distribution, given by the activities within the pooling region. The approach is hyper-parameter free and can be combined with other regularization approaches, such as dropout and data augmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on four image datasets, relative to other approaches that do not utilize data augmentation.

AB  - When a large feedforward neural network is trained on a small training set, it typically performs poorly on held-out test data. This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.

AB  - We consider the problem of designing models to leverage a recently introduced approximate model averaging technique called dropout. We define a simple new model called maxout (so named because its output is the max of a set of inputs, and because it is a natural companion to dropout) designed to both facilitate optimization by dropout and improve the accuracy of dropout's fast approximate model averaging technique. We empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of these tasks. We use maxout and dropout to demonstrate state of the art classification performance on four benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.

AB  - Crowdsourcing systems, in which numerous tasks are electronically distributed to numerous "information piece-workers", have emerged as an effective paradigm for human-powered solving of large scale problems in domains such as image classification, data entry, optical character recognition, recommendation, and proofreading. Because these low-paid workers can be unreliable, nearly all such systems must devise schemes to increase confidence in their answers, typically by assigning each task multiple times and combining the answers in an appropriate manner, e.g. majority voting. In this paper, we consider a general model of such crowdsourcing tasks and pose the problem of minimizing the total price (i.e., number of task assignments) that must be paid to achieve a target overall reliability. We give a new algorithm for deciding which tasks to assign to which workers and for inferring correct answers from the workers' answers. We show that our algorithm, inspired by belief propagation and low-rank matrix approximation, significantly outperforms majority voting and, in fact, is optimal through comparison to an oracle that knows the reliability of every worker. Further, we compare our approach with a more general class of algorithms which can dynamically assign tasks. By adaptively deciding which questions to ask to the next arriving worker, one might hope to reduce uncertainty more efficiently. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, the minimum price necessary to achieve a target reliability scales in the same manner under both adaptive and non-adaptive scenarios. Hence, our non-adaptive approach is order-optimal under both scenarios. This strongly relies on the fact that workers are fleeting and can not be exploited. Therefore, architecturally, our results suggest that building a reliable worker-reputation system is essential to fully harnessing the potential of adaptive designs.

AB  - The isotropy of the universal Hubble expansion is a fundamental tenet of physical cosmology, but it has not been precisely tested during the current epoch, when dark energy is dominant. Anisotropic expansion will produce a shearing velocity field, causing objects to stream toward directions of faster expansion and away from directions of slower expansion. This work tests the basic cosmological assumption of isotropic expansion and thus the isotropy of dark energy. The simplest anisotropy will manifest as a quadrupolar curl-free proper motion vector field. We derive this theoretical signature using a tri-axial expanding metric with a flat geometry (Bianchi I model), generalizing and correcting previous work. We then employ the best current data, the Titov & Lambert (2013) proper motion catalog of 429 objects, to measure the isotropy of universal expansion. We demonstrate that the Hubble expansion is isotropic to 7% (1 $\sigma$), corresponding to streaming motions of 1 microarcsecond/yr, in the best-constrained directions (-19% and +17% in the least-constrained directions) and does not significantly deviate from isotropy in any direction. The Gaia mission, which is expected to obtain proper motions for 500,000 quasars, will likely constrain the anisotropy below 1%.

AB  - We have studied ~2100 early-type galaxies in the SDSS DR3 which have been detected by the GALEX Medium Imaging Survey (MIS), in the redshift range 0<z<0.11. Combining GALEX UV photometry with corollary optical data from the SDSS, we find that, at a 95% confidence level, at least ~30% of galaxies in this sample have UV to optical colors consistent with some recent star formation within the last Gyr. In particular, galaxies with an NUV-r color less than 5.5 are very likely to have experienced such recent star formation, taking into account the possibility of a contribution to NUV flux from the UV upturn phenomenon. We find quantitative agreement between the observations and the predictions of a semianalytical LambdaCDM hierarchical merger model and deduce that early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0<z<0.11 have ~1%-3% of their stellar mass in stars less than 1 Gyr old. The average age of this recently formed population is ~300-500 Myr. We also find that ``monolithically'' evolving galaxies, where recent star formation can be driven solely by recycled gas from stellar mass loss, cannot exhibit the blue colors (NUV-r<5.5) seen in a significant fraction (~30%) of our observed sample.

AB  - We present a spatially resolved near-UV/optical study, using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on board the Hubble Space Telescope, of NGC 4150, a sub-L *, early-type galaxy (ETG) of around 6 × 109 M sun, which has been observed as part of the WFC3 Early-Release Science Programme. Previous work indicates that this galaxy has a large reservoir of molecular hydrogen gas, exhibits a kinematically decoupled core (a likely indication of recent merging) and strong, central Hbeta absorption (indicative of young stars). While relatively uninspiring in its optical image, the core of NGC 4150 shows ubiquitous near-UV emission and remarkable dusty substructure. Our analysis shows this galaxy to lie in the near-UV green valley, and its pixel-by-pixel photometry exhibits a narrow range of near-UV/optical colors that are similar to those of nearby E+A (post-starburst) galaxies and lie between those of M83 (an actively star-forming spiral) and the local quiescent ETG population. We parameterize the properties of the recent star formation (RSF; age, mass fraction, metallicity, and internal dust content) in the NGC 4150 pixels by comparing the observed near-UV/optical photometry to stellar models. The typical age of the RSF is around 0.9 Gyr, consistent with the similarity of the near-UV colors to post-starburst systems, while the morphological structure of the young component supports the proposed merger scenario. The typical RSF metallicity, representative of the metallicity of the gas fuelling star formation, is ~0.3-0.5 Z sun. Assuming that this galaxy is a merger and that the gas is sourced mainly from the infalling companion, these metallicities plausibly indicate the gas-phase metallicity (GPM) of the accreted satellite. Comparison to the local mass-GPM relation suggests (crudely) that the mass of the accreted system is ~3 × 108 M sun, making NGC 4150 a 1:20 minor merger. A summation of the pixel RSF mass fractions indicates that the RSF contributes ~2%-3% of the stellar mass. This work reaffirms our hypothesis that minor mergers play a significant role in the evolution of ETGs at late epochs.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Incorporated, under NASA contract NAS5-26555.

AB  - We investigate the relationship between colour and structure within galaxies using a large, volume-limited sample of bright, low-redshift galaxies with optical to near-infrared imaging from the GAMA survey. We fit single-component, wavelength-dependent, elliptical S\'ersic models to all passbands simultaneously, using software developed by the MegaMorph project. Dividing our sample by S\'ersic index and colour, the recovered wavelength variations in effective radius (R_e) and S\'ersic index (n) reveal the internal structure, and hence formation history, of different types of galaxies. All these trends depend on n; some have an additional dependence on galaxy colour. Late-type galaxies (n_r < 2.5) show a dramatic increase in S\'ersic index with wavelength. This might be a result of their two-component (bulge-disk) nature, though stellar population gradients within each component and dust attenuation are likely to play a role. All galaxies show a substantial decrease in R_e with wavelength. This is strongest for early-types (n_r > 2.5), even though they maintain constant n with wavelength, revealing that ellipticals are a superimposition of different stellar populations associated with multiple collapse and merging events. Processes leading to structures with larger R_e must be associated with lower metallicity or younger stellar populations. This appears to rule out the formation of young cores through dissipative gas accretion as an important mechanism in the recent lives of luminous elliptical galaxies.

AB  - We present a full-sky 100 mu m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 mu m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 mu m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 mu m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 mu m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 mu m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 mu m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 mu m (95% confidence). This integrated flux ~2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 mu m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.

AB  - We report results from the BICEP2 experiment, a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarimeter specifically designed to search for the signal of inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode power spectrum around l=80. The telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refracting optical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition edge sensor (TES) 150 GHz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of approx. 300 uk.sqrt(s). BICEP2 observed from the South Pole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with an effective area of 380 square degrees was observed to a depth of 87 nK-degrees in Stokes Q and U. In this paper we describe the observations, data reduction, maps, simulations and results. We find an excess of B-mode power over the base lensed-LCDM expectation in the range 30<l<150, inconsistent with the null hypothesis at a significance of $>5\sigma$. Through jackknife tests and simulations based on detailed calibration measurements we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the observed excess. We also estimate potential foreground signals and find that available models predict these to be considerably smaller than the observed signal. These foreground models possess no significant cross-correlation with our maps. Additionally, cross-correlating BICEP2 against 100 GHz maps from the BICEP1 experiment, the excess signal is confirmed with $3\sigma$ significance and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of the CMB, disfavoring synchrotron or dust at $2.3\sigma$ and $2.2\sigma$, respectively. The observed B-mode power spectrum is well-fit by a lensed-LCDM + tensor theoretical model with tensor/scalar ratio $r=0.20^+0.07_-0.05$, with r=0 disfavored at $7.0\sigma$. Subtracting the best available estimate for foreground dust modifies the likelihood slightly so that r=0 is disfavored at $5.9\sigma$.

AB  - We summarize what large surveys of the contemporary universe have taught us about the physics and phenomenology of the processes that link the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. We present a picture in which the population of AGN can be divided into two distinct populations. The Radiative-Mode AGN are associated with black holes that produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of ~1% of the Eddington Limit. They are primarily associated with less massive black holes growing in high-density pseudo-bulges at a rate sufficient to produce the total mass budget in these black holes in ~10 Gyr. The circum-nuclear environment contains high density cold gas and associated star-formation. Major mergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback will be generic in these objects and strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGN. In Jet-Mode AGN the bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets). These AGN are associated with the more massive black holes in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these black holes nor star-formation in their host bulge is significant today. These AGN are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift universe are painting a similar picture. (Abridged).

AB  - I present a comprehensive review of the evolution of galaxy structure in the universe from the first galaxies we can currently observe at z~6 down to galaxies we see in the local universe. I further address how these changes reveal galaxy formation processes that galaxy structural analyses can provide. This review is pedagogical and begins with a detailed discussion of the major methods in which galaxies are studied morphologically and structurally. This includes the well-established visual method; Sersic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness profile shapes; non-parametric structural methods including the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) (CAS) method, as well as newer structural indices. Included is a discussion of how these structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies such as their scale, star formation rate, and ongoing merger activity. Extensive observational results are shown demonstrating how broad galaxy morphologies and structures change with time up to z~3, from small, compact and peculiar systems in the distant universe to the formation of the Hubble sequence we find today. This review further addresses how structural methods measure accurately the merger history out to z~3. The properties and evolution of bulges, disks, bars, and at z>1 large star forming clumps are also described, along with how morphological galaxy quenching occurs. Furthermore, the role of environment in producing structure in galaxies over cosmic time is treated. Alongside the evolution of general structure, I also delineate how galaxy sizes change with time, with measured sizes up to a factor of 2-5 smaller at high redshift at a given stellar mass. This review concludes with a discussion of how galaxy structure reveals the formation mechanisms behind galaxies, providing a new and unique way to test theories of galaxy formation.

AB  - We present evidence that recurrent spiral activity, long manifested in simulations of disk galaxies, results from the super-position of a few transient spiral modes. Each mode lasts between five and ten rotations at its corotation radius where its amplitude is greatest. The scattering of stars as each wave decays takes place over narrow ranges of angular momentum, causing abrupt changes to the impedance of the disk to subsequent traveling waves. Partial reflections of waves at these newly created features, allows new standing-wave instabilities to appear that saturate and decay in their turn, scattering particles at new locations, creating a recurring cycle. The spiral activity causes the general level of random motion to rise, gradually decreasing the ability of the disk to support further activity unless the disk contains a dissipative gas component from which stars form on near-circular orbits. We also show that this interpretation is consistent with the behavior reported in other recent simulations with low mass-disks.

AB  - We study the effects of radio jets on galaxies in their vicinity (satellites) and the role of satellites in triggering radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The study compares the aggregate properties of satellites of a sample of 7,220 radio AGNs at z < 0.3 (identified by Best & Heckman 2012 from the SDSS and NVSS+FIRST surveys) to the satellites of a control sample of radio-quiet galaxies, which are matched in redshift, color, luminosity, and axis ratio, as well as by environment type: field galaxies, cluster members and brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Remarkably, we find that radio AGNs exhibit on average a 50% excess (17\sigma significance) in the number of satellites within 100 kpc even though the cluster membership was controlled for (e.g., radio BCGs have more satellites than radio-quiet BCGs, etc.). Satellite excess is not confirmed for high-excitation sources, which are only 2% of radio AGN. Extra satellites may be responsible for raising the probability for hot gas AGN accretion via tidal effects or may otherwise enhance the intensity or duration of the radio-emitting phase. Furthermore, we find that the incidence of radio AGNs among potential hosts (massive ellipticals) is similar for field galaxies and for non-BCG cluster members, suggesting that AGN fueling depends primarily on conditions in the host halo rather than the parent, cluster halo. Regarding feedback, we find that radio AGNs, either high or low excitation, have no detectable effect on star formation in their satellites, as neither induced star formation nor star formation quenching is present in more than ~1% of radio AGN.

AB  - The Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey furnishes a deep redshift catalog that, when combined with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), allows us to explore for the first time the mid-infrared properties of >110, 000 galaxies over 120 deg2 to z ~= 0.5. In this paper we detail the procedure for producing the matched GAMA-WISE catalog for the G12 and G15 fields, in particular characterizing and measuring resolved sources; the complete catalogs for all three GAMA equatorial fields will be made available through the GAMA public releases. The wealth of multiwavelength photometry and optical spectroscopy allows us to explore empirical relations between optically determined stellar mass (derived from synthetic stellar population models) and 3.4 mum and 4.6 mum WISE measurements. Similarly dust-corrected Halpha-derived star formation rates can be compared to 12 mum and 22 mum luminosities to quantify correlations that can be applied to large samples to z < 0.5. To illustrate the applications of these relations, we use the 12 mum star formation prescription to investigate the behavior of specific star formation within the GAMA-WISE sample and underscore the ability of WISE to detect star-forming systems at z ~ 0.5. Within galaxy groups (determined by a sophisticated friends-of-friends scheme), results suggest that galaxies with a neighbor within 100 h --1 kpc have, on average, lower specific star formation rates than typical GAMA galaxies with the same stellar mass.

AB  - We explore the simple inter-relationships between mass, star formation rate, and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS, and other deep surveys. We take a purely empirical approach in identifying those features of galaxy evolution that are demanded by the data and then explore the analytic consequences of these. We show that the differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, leading to the idea of two distinct processes of "mass quenching" and "environment quenching." The effect of environment quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z ~ 1 in zCOSMOS, suggesting that the environment quenching occurs as large-scale structure develops in the universe, probably through the cessation of star formation in 30%-70% of satellite galaxies. In contrast, mass quenching appears to be a more dynamic process, governed by a quenching rate. We show that the observed constancy of the Schechter M* and alphas for star-forming galaxies demands that the quenching of galaxies around and above M* must follow a rate that is statistically proportional to their star formation rates (or closely mimic such a dependence). We then postulate that this simple mass-quenching law in fact holds over a much broader range of stellar mass (2 dex) and cosmic time. We show that the combination of these two quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging naturally produces (1) a quasi-static single Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with an exponential cutoff at a value M* that is set uniquely by the constant of proportionality between the star formation and mass quenching rates and (2) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components. The dominant component (at high masses) is produced by mass quenching and has exactly the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but a faint end slope that differs by Deltaalphas ~ 1. The other component is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and alphas as the star-forming galaxies but an amplitude that is strongly dependent on environment. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies will modify these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, mildly increasing M* and making alphas slightly more negative. All of these detailed quantitative inter-relationships between the Schechter parameters of the star-forming and passive galaxies, across a broad range of environments, are indeed seen to high accuracy in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically based model. We find that the amount of post-quenching "dry merging" that could have occurred is quite constrained. Our model gives a prediction for the mass function of the population of transitory objects that are in the process of being quenched. Our simple empirical laws for the cessation of star formation in galaxies also naturally produce the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean age with mass for passive galaxies, as well as the qualitative variation of formation timescale indicated by the relative alpha-element abundances.

AB  - We extend the phenomenological study of the evolving galaxy population of Peng et al. (2010) to the central/satellite dichotomy in Yang et al. Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) groups. We find that satellite galaxies are responsible for all the environmental effects in our earlier work. The fraction of centrals that are red does not depend on their environment but only on their stellar masses, whereas that of the satellites depends on both. We define a relative satellite quenching efficiency εsat, which is the fraction of blue centrals that are quenched upon becoming the satellite of another galaxy. This is shown to be independent of stellar mass, but to depend strongly on local overdensity, delta, ranging between 0.2 and at least 0.8. The red fraction of satellites correlate much better with the local overdensity delta, a measure of location within the group, than with the richness of the group, i.e., dark matter halo mass. This, and the fact that satellite quenching depends on local density and not on either the stellar mass of the galaxy or the dark matter halo mass, gives clues as to the nature of the satellite-quenching process. We furthermore show that the action of mass quenching on satellite galaxies is also independent of the dark matter mass of the parent halo. We then apply the Peng et al. approach to predict the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies, split into passive and active galaxies, and show that these match very well the observed mass functions from SDSS, further strengthening the validity of this phenomenological approach. We highlight the fact that the observed M* is exactly the same for the star-forming centrals and satellites and the observed M* for the star-forming satellites is independent of halo mass above 1012 M &sun;, which emphasizes the universality of the mass-quenching process that we identified in Peng et al. Post-quenching merging modifies the mass function of the central galaxies but can increase the mass of typical centrals by only about 25%.

AB  - We explore the basic parameters that drive the evolution of the fundamental properties of star forming galaxies within the gas regulator model, or bathtub-model. We derive the general analytic form of the evolution of the key galaxy properties, i.e. gas mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, specific SFR, gas fraction, gas phase metallicity and stellar metallicity, without assuming that galaxies live in the equilibrium state. We find that the timescale required to reach equilibrium, tau_eq, which is determined by the product of star-formation efficiency and mass-loading factor, is the central parameter in the gas regulator model that is essentially in control of the evolution of all key galaxy properties. The scatters in most of the key scaling relations are primarily governed by tau_eq. Most strikingly, the predicted sSFR evolution is controlled solely by tau_eq (apart from the cosmic time). Although the precise evolution of the sSFR depends on tau_eq, the sSFR history is largely insensitive to different values of tau_eq. The difference between the minimum and maximum sSFR at any epoch is less than a factor of four. The shape of the predicted sSFR history simply mimics that of the specific mass increase rate of the dark matter halos (sMIR_DM) with the typical value of the sSFR around 2*sMIR_DM. The predicted sSFR from the gas regulator model is in good agreement with typical Semi-Analytic Models (SAMs), but both are fundamentally different from the observed sSFR history. This clearly implies that some key process is missing in both typical SAMs and gas regulator model, and we hint at some possible culprit. We emphasize the critical role of tau_eq in controlling the evolution of the galaxy population, especially for gas rich low mass galaxies that are very unlikely to live around the equilibrium state at any epoch and this has been largely ignored in many similar studies.

AB  - Astronomy produces extremely large data sets from ground-based telescopes, space missions, and simulation. The volume and complexity of these rich data sets require new approaches and advanced tools to understand the information contained therein. No one can load this data on their own computer, most cannot even keep it at their institution, and worse, no platform exists that allows one to evaluate their models across the whole of the data. Simply having an extremely large volume of data available in one place is not sufficient; one must be able to make valid, rigorous, scientific comparisons across very different data sets from very different instrumentation. We propose a framework to directly address this which has the following components: a model-based computational platform, streamlined access to large volumes of data, and an educational and social platform for both researchers and the public.

AB  - Elliptical galaxies moving through clusters seem likely to retain a significant interstellar medium (ISM). A simple estimate gives this region a characteristic radius of about 10 kpc. Within this radius the influence of the ISM must be included in any model of radio source structure. Since this scale is similar to that of the small-scale structure now being seen in head-tail radio sources, it suggests that the interstellar medium may be important in the formation of these sources. An alternative model of head-tail sources is suggested in which nonrelativistic or mildly relativistic beams are deflected by transverse pressure gradients induced within the interstellar medium by the galactic motion. It is further suggested that the large-scale structure of a tailed source may be energized by turbulence in the galactic wake.

AB  - Total intensity maps and optical identifications are presented for six head-tail radio sources observed in the directions of Abell clusters of galaxies with the NRAO interferometer at 2695 MHz. Characteristic parameters for each source are derived from the radio observations and are found to be similar to those of other known head-tail sources in rich clusters. It is shown that a single galaxy is coincident with the head of each source and that there is no tendency for the tails to be pointing toward or away from their respective cluster centers. A classification scheme based on degree of optical dominance is suggested which illustrates the correlation between head-tail sources and galaxies of lower optical luminosity. It is concluded that the gross characteristics of head-tail sources may be consistently described in terms of relative motions of radio galaxies through the local intergalactic medium in clusters of galaxies.

AB  - In recent years, the number of pulsars with secure mass measurements has increased to a level that allows us to probe the underlying neutron star (NS) mass distribution in detail. We critically review the radio pulsar mass measurements. For the first time, we are able to analyze a sizable population of NSs with a flexible modeling approach that can effectively accommodate a skewed underlying distribution and asymmetric measurement errors. We find that NSs that have evolved through different evolutionary paths reflect distinctive signatures through dissimilar distribution peak and mass cutoff values. NSs in double NS and NS-white dwarf (WD) systems show consistent respective peaks at 1.33 M ☉ and 1.55 M ☉, suggesting significant mass accretion (Deltam ≈ 0.22 M ☉) has occurred during the spin-up phase. The width of the mass distribution implied by double NS systems is indicative of a tight initial mass function while the inferred mass range is significantly wider for NSs that have gone through recycling. We find a mass cutoff at ~2.1 M ☉ for NSs with WD companions, which establishes a firm lower bound for the maximum NS mass. This rules out the majority of strange quark and soft equation of state models as viable configurations for NS matter. The lack of truncation close to the maximum mass cutoff along with the skewed nature of the inferred mass distribution both enforce the suggestion that the 2.1 M ☉ limit is set by evolutionary constraints rather than nuclear physics or general relativity, and the existence of rare supermassive NSs is possible.

AB  - Life arose on Earth sometime in the first few hundred million years after the young planet had cooled to the point that it could support water-based organisms on its surface. The early emergence of life on Earth has been taken as evidence that the probability of abiogenesis is high, if starting from young Earth-like conditions. We revisit this argument quantitatively in a Bayesian statistical framework. By constructing a simple model of the probability of abiogenesis, we calculate a Bayesian estimate of its posterior probability, given the data that life emerged fairly early in Earthâs history and that, billions of years later, curious creatures noted this fact and considered its implications. We find that, given only this very limited empirical information, the choice of Bayesian prior for the abiogenesis probability parameter has a dominant influence on the computed posterior probability. Although terrestrial life's early emergence provides evidence that life might be abundant in the universe if early-Earth-like conditions are common, the evidence is inconclusive and indeed is consistent with an arbitrarily low intrinsic probability of abiogenesis for plausible uninformative priors. Finding a single case of life arising independently of our lineage (on Earth, elsewhere in the solar system, or on an extrasolar planet) would provide much stronger evidence that abiogenesis is not extremely rare in the universe.

AB  - The OPERA neutrino experiment at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory has measured the velocity of neutrinos from the CERN CNGS beam over a baseline of about 730 km. The measurement is based on data taken by OPERA in the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Dedicated upgrades of the CNGS timing system and of the OPERA detector, as well as a high precision geodesy campaign for the measurement of the neutrino baseline, allowed reaching comparable systematic and statistical accuracies. An arrival time of CNGS muon neutrinos with respect to the one computed assuming the speed of light in vacuum of ( 6.5$\pm$ 7.4( stat. )_-8.0^+8.3( sys. ) )ns was measured corresponding to a relative difference of the muon neutrino velocity with respect to the speed of light ( \upsilon -c ) / c .=( 2.7$\pm$ 3.1( stat. )_-3.3^+3.4( sys. ) )× 10^-6  . The above result, obtained by comparing the time distributions of neutrino interactions and of protons hitting the CNGS target in 10.5 mus long extractions, was confirmed by a test performed at the end of 2011 using a short bunch beam allowing to measure the neutrino time of flight at the single interaction level.

AB  - Although the supermassive (AGN) and stellar mass (BHBs) black holes have many properties in common, the broad emission lines (BELs) are exclusively signatures of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). Based on the detection of these lines from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data bases, there seems to be no AGN with mass MBH ≲ 105 M&sun;. In this paper, we investigate if such low-mass black holes are really non-existent or they are undetected because the BELs in them are not produced efficiently. Using the ionizing spectral energy distribution for a wide range of black hole mass, 10-109 M&sun;, spanning black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) to AGN, we calculate the equivalent widths (EWs) of ultraviolet and optical lines Lyalpha 1216 Å, Hbeta 4861 Å, C IV 1549 Å and Mg II 2798 Å. The LOC (locally optimally emitting cloud) model has been used to describe the broad emission-line region (BELR) for the calculations. We find that the hardening of the SED shape with decreasing mass do not decrease the BEL EWs. However, finite size of the BELR, as measured by the line widths, which is controlled by the mass of the black hole, regulates the production of these emission lines. There seems to be a peak in the EWs of the emission lines for typical AGN black holes of ˜108 M&sun;, below which the lines become intrinsically fainter with a sharp fall-off below ˜106 M&sun;. This may be the cause of the absence of low-mass AGN in SDSS.

AB  - The early-type galaxy (ETG) mass-size relation has largely been studied to understand how these galaxies assembled their mass. One key observational result of the last years is that massive galaxies increased their size by a factor of a few at fixed stellar mass from z ~ 2. Hierarchical models favor minor mergers as a plausible driver of this size growth. Some of these models predict a significant environmental dependence in the sense that galaxies residing in more massive halos tend to be larger than galaxies in lower mass halos, at fixed stellar mass and redshift. At present, observational results of this environmental dependence are contradictory. In this paper we revisit this issue in the local universe, by investigating how the sizes of massive ETGs depend on a large-scale environment using an updated and accurate sample of ETGs in different environments---field, group, and clusters---from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7. Our analysis does not show any significant environmental dependence of the sizes of central and satellite ETGs at fixed stellar mass at z ~ 0. The size-mass relation of early-type galaxies at z ~ 0 seems to be universal, i.e., independent of the mass of the host halo and of the position of the galaxy in that halo (central or satellite). The result is robust to different galaxy selections based on star formation, morphology, or central density. Considering our observational errors and the size of the sample, any size ratio larger than 30%-40% between massive galaxies (log(M */M ☉) > 11) living in clusters and in the field can be ruled out at 3sigma level.

AB  - We present a new comprehensive model of the physics of galaxy formation designed for large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation using the moving-mesh code AREPO. Our model includes primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution and feedback processes, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, a novel subgrid model for the metal loading of outflows, black hole (BH) seeding, BH growth and merging procedures, quasar- and radio-mode feedback, and a prescription for radiative electromagnetic (EM) feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our stellar evolution and chemical enrichment scheme follows nine elements (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe) independently. Stellar feedback is realized through kinetic outflows. The metal mass loading of outflows can be adjusted independently of the wind mass loading. This is required to simultaneously reproduce the stellar mass content of low-mass haloes and their gas oxygen abundances. Radiative EM AGN feedback is implemented assuming an average spectral energy distribution and a luminosity-dependent scaling of obscuration effects. This form of feedback suppresses star formation more efficiently than continuous thermal quasar-mode feedback alone, but is less efficient than mechanical radio-mode feedback in regulating star formation in massive haloes. We contrast simulation predictions for different variants of our galaxy formation model with key observations, allowing us to constrain the importance of different modes of feedback and their uncertain efficiency parameters. We identify a fiducial best match model and show that it reproduces, among other things, the cosmic star formation history, the stellar mass function, the stellar mass-halo mass relation, g-, r-, i- and z-band SDSS galaxy luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher relation. We can achieve this success only if we invoke very strong forms of stellar and AGN feedback such that star formation is adequately reduced in both low- and high-mass systems. In particular, the strength of radio-mode feedback needs to be increased significantly compared to previous studies to suppress efficient cooling in massive, metal-enriched haloes.

AB  - We use collisionless N-body simulations to determine how the growth of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) influences the nuclear kinematics in both barred and unbarred galaxies. In the presence of a bar, the increase in the velocity dispersion sigma (within the effective radius) due to the growth of an SMBH is on average <~ 10%, whereas the increase is only <~ 4% in an unbarred galaxy. In a barred galaxy, the increase results from a combination of three separate factors: (1) orientation and inclination effects; (2) angular momentum transport by the bar that results in an increase in the central mass density; and (3) an increase in the vertical and radial velocity anisotropy of stars in the vicinity of the SMBH. In contrast, the growth of the SMBH in an unbarred galaxy causes the velocity distribution in the inner part of the nucleus to become less radially anisotropic. The increase in sigma following the growth of the SMBH is insensitive to a variation of a factor of 10 in the final mass of the SMBH, showing that it is the growth process rather than the actual SMBH mass that alters bar evolution in a way that increases sigma. We argue that using an axisymmetric stellar dynamical modeling code to measure SMBH masses in barred galaxies could result in a slight overestimate of the derived M BH, especially if a constant M/L ratio is assumed. We conclude that the growth of a black hole in the presence of a bar could result in an increase in sigma that is roughly 4%-8% larger than the increase that occurs in an axisymmetric system. While the increase in sigma due to SMBH growth in a barred galaxy might partially account for the claimed offset of barred galaxies and pseudo bulges from the M BH-sigma relation obtained for elliptical galaxies and classical bulges in unbarred galaxies, it is inadequate to account for all of the offset.

AB  - We examine the star formation properties of bright (˜0.1 L*) satellites around isolated ˜L* hosts in the local Universe using spectroscopically confirmed systems in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. Our selection method is carefully designed with the aid of N-body simulations to avoid groups and clusters. We find that satellites are significantly more likely to be quenched than a stellar mass-matched sample of isolated galaxies. Remarkably, this quenching occurs only for satellites of hosts that are themselves quenched: while star formation is unaffected in the satellites of star-forming hosts, satellites around quiescent hosts are more than twice as likely to be quenched than stellar-mass-matched field samples. One implication of this is that whatever shuts down star formation in isolated, passive L* galaxies also play at least an indirect role in quenching star formation in their bright satellites. The previously reported tendency for `galactic conformity' in colour/morphology may be a by-product of this host-specific quenching dichotomy. The Sérsic indices of quenched satellites are statistically identical to those of field galaxies with the same specific star formation rates, suggesting that environmental and secular quenching give rise to the same morphological structure. By studying the distribution of pairwise velocities between the hosts and satellites, we find dynamical evidence that passive host galaxies reside in dark matter haloes that are ˜45 per cent more massive than those of star-forming host galaxies of the same stellar mass. We emphasize that even around passive hosts, the mere fact that galaxies become satellites does not typically result in star formation quenching: we find that only ˜30 per cent of ˜0.1L* galaxies that fall in from the field are quenched around passive hosts, compared with ˜0 per cent around star-forming hosts.

AB  - Star-forming disk galaxies at high redshift are often subject to violent disk instability, characterized by giant clumps whose fate is yet to be understood. The main question is whether the clumps disrupt within their dynamical timescale (<=50 Myr), like the molecular clouds in today's galaxies, or whether they survive stellar feedback for more than a disk orbital time (≈300 Myr) in which case they can migrate inward and help building the central bulge. We present 3.5-7 pc resolution adaptive mesh refinement simulations of high-redshift disks including photoionization, radiation pressure, and supernovae feedback. Our modeling of radiation pressure determines the mass loading and initial velocity of winds from basic physical principles. We find that the giant clumps produce steady outflow rates comparable to and sometimes somewhat larger than their star formation rate, with velocities largely sufficient to escape the galaxy. The clumps also lose mass, especially old stars, by tidal stripping, and the stellar populations contained in the clumps hence remain relatively young (<=200 Myr), as observed. The clumps survive gaseous outflows and stellar loss, because they are wandering in gas-rich turbulent disks from which they can reaccrete gas at high rates compensating for outflows and tidal stripping, overall keeping realistic and self-regulated gaseous and stellar masses. The outflow and accretion rates have specific timescales of a few 108 yr, as opposed to rapid and repeated dispersion and reformation of clumps. Our simulations produce gaseous outflows with velocities, densities, and mass loading consistent with observations, and at the same time suggest that the giant clumps survive for hundreds of Myr and complete their migration to the center of high-redshift galaxies. These long-lived clumps are gas-dominated and contain a moderate mass fraction of stars; they drive inside-out disk evolution, thickening, spheroid growth, and fueling of the central black hole.

AB  - The X-ray emission mechanism in large-scale jets of powerful radio quasars has been a source of debate in recent years, with two competing interpretations: either the X-rays are of synchrotron origin, arising from a different electron energy distribution than that producing the radio to optical synchrotron component, or they are due to inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons (IC/CMB) by relativistic electrons in a powerful relativistic jet with bulk Lorentz factor Gamma ~ 10-20. These two models imply radically different conditions in the large-scale jet in terms of jet speed, kinetic power, and maximum energy of the particle acceleration mechanism, with important implications for the impact of the jet on the large-scale environment. A large part of the X-ray origin debate has centered on the well-studied source 3C 273. Here we present new observations from Fermi which put an upper limit on the gamma-ray flux from the large-scale jet of 3C 273 that violates at a confidence greater that 99.9% the flux expected from the IC/CMB X-ray model found by extrapolation of the UV to X-ray spectrum of knot A, thus ruling out the IC/CMB interpretation entirely for this source when combined with previous work. Further, this upper limit from Fermi puts a limit on the Doppler beaming factor of at least delta < 9, assuming equipartition fields, and possibly as low as delta < 5, assuming no major deceleration of the jet from knots A through D1.

AB  - We introduce the Assembling Galaxies Of Resolved Anatomy (AGORA) project, a comprehensive numerical study of well-resolved galaxies within the LambdaCDM cosmology. Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with force resolutions of ~100 proper pc or better will be run with a variety of code platforms to follow the hierarchical growth, star formation history, morphological transformation, and the cycle of baryons in and out of eight galaxies with halo masses M vir ~= 1010, 1011, 1012, and 1013 M ☉ at z = 0 and two different ("violent" and "quiescent") assembly histories. The numerical techniques and implementations used in this project include the smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes GADGET and GASOLINE, and the adaptive mesh refinement codes ART, ENZO, and RAMSES. The codes share common initial conditions and common astrophysics packages including UV background, metal-dependent radiative cooling, metal and energy yields of supernovae, and stellar initial mass function. These are described in detail in the present paper. Subgrid star formation and feedback prescriptions will be tuned to provide a realistic interstellar and circumgalactic medium using a non-cosmological disk galaxy simulation. Cosmological runs will be systematically compared with each other using a common analysis toolkit and validated against observations to verify that the solutions are robust---i.e., that the astrophysical assumptions are responsible for any success, rather than artifacts of particular implementations. The goals of the AGORA project are, broadly speaking, to raise the realism and predictive power of galaxy simulations and the understanding of the feedback processes that regulate galaxy "metabolism." The initial conditions for the AGORA galaxies as well as simulation outputs at various epochs will be made publicly available to the community. The proof-of-concept dark-matter-only test of the formation of a galactic halo with a z = 0 mass of M vir ~= 1.7 × 1011 M ☉ by nine different versions of the participating codes is also presented to validate the infrastructure of the project.

AB  - We use measurements of the stellar mass function, galaxy clustering, and galaxy-galaxy lensing within the COSMOS survey to constrain the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) of star forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range z = [0.2, 1.0]. For massive galaxies, M * >~ 1010.6 M ☉, our results indicate that star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matter halos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth. At lower masses, there is minimal difference in the SHMRs, implying that the majority low-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their star formation. Our analysis also affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into the relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At z = 1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar mass function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshift evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass central galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M * ~ 1010 M ☉, the fraction of central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of 10 over our redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at that mass is constant with redshift. We define a "migration rate" to the red sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. We find that the migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearly an order of magnitude from z = 1 to z = 0. These results imply that the efficiency of quenching star formation for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while the mechanisms that quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters is losing efficiency.

AB  - The Hubble constant, H 0, or its dimensionless equivalent, "little h", is a fundamental cosmological property that is now known to an accuracy better than a few per cent. Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a `cheat sheet' of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis.

AB  - Context. Galaxies, which often contain ionised gas, sometimes also exhibit a so-called low-ionisation nuclear emission line region (LINER). For 30 years, this was attributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (more commonly known as active galactic nucleus, AGN) of low luminosity, making LINER galaxies the largest AGN sub-population, which dominate in numbers over higher luminosity Seyfert galaxies and quasars. This, however, poses a serious problem. While the inferred energy balance is plausible, many LINERs clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an AGN.  Aims: Using integral field spectroscopic data from the CALIFA survey, we compare the observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected from illumination by an AGN.  Methods: Essential for this analysis is a proper extraction of emission lines, especially weak lines, such as Balmer Hbeta lines, which are superposed on an absorption trough. To accomplish this, we use the GANDALF code, which simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines.  Results: For 48 galaxies with LINER-like emission, we show that the radial emission-line surface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a central point-source and hence cannot be due to an AGN alone.  Conclusions: The most probable explanation for the excess LINER-like emission is ionisation by evolved stars during the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-AGB. This leads us to an entirely new interpretation. Post-AGB stars are ubiquitous and their ionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with the gas present and with stars older than ~1 Gyr unless a stronger radiation field from young hot stars or an AGN outshines them. This means that galaxies with LINER-like emission are not a class defined by a property but rather by the absence of a property. It also explains why LINER emission is observed mostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.

AB  - We present the results of a comparison between the environments of (1) a complete sample of 46 southern 2-Jy radio galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.05 < z < 0.7), (2) a complete sample of 20 radio-quiet type-2 quasars (0.3 <= z <= 0.41), and (3) a control sample of 107 quiescent early-type galaxies at 0.2 <= z < 0.7 in the Extended Groth Strip. The environments have been quantified using angular clustering amplitudes (Bgq) derived from deep optical imaging data. Based on these comparisons, we discuss the role of the environment in the triggering of powerful radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars. When we compare the Bgq distributions of the type-2 quasars and quiescent early-type galaxies, we find no significant difference between them. This is consistent with the radio-quiet quasar phase being a short-lived but ubiquitous stage in the formation of all massive early-type galaxies. On the other hand, powerful radio galaxies are in denser environments than the quiescent population, and this difference between distributions of Bgq is significant at the 3sigma level. This result supports a physical origin of radio loudness, with high-density gas environments favouring the transformation of active galactic nucleus (AGN) power into radio luminosity, or alternatively, affecting the properties of the supermassive black holes themselves. Finally, focusing on the radio-loud sources only, we find that the clustering of weak-line radio galaxies (WLRGs) is higher than the strong-line radio galaxies (SLRGs), constituting a 3sigma result. 82 per cent of the 2-Jy WLRGs are in clusters, according to our definition (Bgq ≳ 400), versus only 31 per cent of the SLRGs.

AB  - The distribution of galaxies on the mass-size plane as a function of redshift or environment is a powerful test for galaxy formation models. Here we use integral-field stellar kinematics to interpret the variation of the mass-size distribution in two galaxy samples spanning extreme environmental densities. The samples are both identically and nearly mass-selected (stellar mass M * >~ 6 × 109 M ☉) and volume-limited. The first consists of nearby field galaxies from the ATLAS3D parent sample. The second consists of galaxies in the Coma Cluster (Abell 1656), one of the densest environments for which good, resolved spectroscopy can be obtained. The mass-size distribution in the dense environment differs from the field one in two ways: (1) spiral galaxies are replaced by bulge-dominated disk-like fast-rotator early-type galaxies (ETGs), which follow the same mass-size relation and have the same mass distribution as in the field sample; (2) the slow-rotator ETGs are segregated in mass from the fast rotators, with their size increasing proportionally to their mass. A transition between the two processes appears around the stellar mass M crit ≈ 2 × 1011 M ☉. We interpret this as evidence for bulge growth (outside-in evolution) and bulge-related environmental quenching dominating at low masses, with little influence from merging. In contrast, significant dry mergers (inside-out evolution) and halo-related quenching drives the mass and size growth at the high-mass end. The existence of these two processes naturally explains the diverse size evolution of galaxies of different masses and the separability of mass and environmental quenching.

AB  - The morphology of galaxies can be quantified to some degree using a set of scale-invariant parameters. Concentration (C), asymmetry (A), smoothness (S), the Gini index (G), the relative contribution of the brightest pixels to the second-order moment of the flux (M 20), ellipticity (E), and the Gini index of the second-order moment (GM ) have all been applied to morphologically classify galaxies at various wavelengths. Here, we present a catalog of these parameters for the Spitzer Survey of stellar structure in Galaxies, a volume-limited, near-infrared (NIR) imaging survey of nearby galaxies using the 3.6 and 4.5 mum channels of the Infrared Array Camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our goal is to provide a reference catalog of NIR quantified morphology for high-redshift studies and galaxy evolution models with enough detail to resolve stellar mass morphology. We explore where normal, non-interacting galaxies---those typically found on the Hubble tuning fork---lie in this parameter space and show that there is a tight relation between concentration (C 82) and M 20 for normal galaxies. M 20 can be used to classify galaxies into earlier and later types (i.e., to separate spirals from irregulars). Several criteria using these parameters exist to select systems with a disturbed morphology, i.e., those that appear to be undergoing a tidal interaction. We examine the applicability of these criteria to Spitzer NIR imaging. We find that four relations, based on the parameters A and S, G and M 20, GM , C, and M 20, respectively, select outliers in morphological parameter space, but each selects different subsets of galaxies. Two criteria (GM > 0.6, G > --0.115 × M 20 + 0.384) seem most appropriate to identify possible mergers and the merger fraction in NIR surveys. We find no strong relation between lopsidedness and most of these morphological parameters, except for a weak dependence of lopsidedness on concentration and M 20.

AB  - Our Galaxy is a complex machine in which several processes operate simultaneously: metal-poor gas is accreted, is chemically enriched by dying stars, and then drifts inwards, surrendering its angular momentum to stars; new stars are formed on nearly circular orbits in the equatorial plane and then diffuse through orbit space to eccentric and inclined orbits; the central stellar bar surrenders angular momentum to the surrounding disc and dark halo while acquiring angular momentum from inspiralling gas; the outer parts of the disc are constantly disturbed by satellite objects, both luminous and dark, as they sweep through pericentre. We review the conceptual tools required to bring these complex happenings into focus. Our first concern must be the construction of equilibrium models of the Galaxy, for upon these hang our hopes of determining the Galaxy's mean gravitational field, which is required for every subsequent step. Ideally our equilibrium model should be formulated so that the secular evolution of the system can be modelled with perturbation theory. Such theory can be used to understand how stars diffuse through orbit space from either the thin gas disc in which we presume disc stars formed, or the debris of an accreted object, the presumed origin of many halo stars. Coupling this understanding to the still very uncertain predictions of the theory of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis, we can finally extract a complete model of the chemodynamic evolution of our reasonably generic Galaxy. We discuss the relation of such a model to cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, which provide general guidance but cannot be relied on for quantitative detail.

AB  - We combine IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer and Herschel PACS and SPIRE measurements to study the dust and gas contents of high-redshift star-forming galaxies. We present new observations for a sample of 17 lensed galaxies at z = 1.4-3.1, which allow us to directly probe the cold interstellar medium of normal star-forming galaxies with stellar masses of ~1010 M ☉, a regime otherwise not (yet) accessible by individual detections in Herschel and molecular gas studies. The lensed galaxies are combined with reference samples of submillimeter and normal z ~ 1-2 star-forming galaxies with similar far-infrared photometry to study the gas and dust properties of galaxies in the SFR-M *-redshift parameter space. The mean gas depletion timescale of main-sequence (MS) galaxies at z > 2 is measured to be only ~450 Myr, a factor of ~1.5 (~5) shorter than at z = 1 (z = 0), in agreement with a (1 + z)--1 scaling. The mean gas mass fraction at z = 2.8 is 40% $\pm$ 15% (44% after incompleteness correction), suggesting a flattening or even a reversal of the trend of increasing gas fractions with redshift recently observed up to z ~ 2. The depletion timescale and gas fractions of the z > 2 normal star-forming galaxies can be explained under the "equilibrium model" for galaxy evolution, in which the gas reservoir of galaxies is the primary driver of the redshift evolution of specific star formation rates. Due to their high star formation efficiencies and low metallicities, the z > 2 lensed galaxies have warm dust despite being located on the star formation MS. At fixed metallicity, they also have a gas-to-dust ratio 1.7 times larger than observed locally when using the same standard techniques, suggesting that applying the local calibration of the deltaGDR-metallicity relation to infer the molecular gas mass of high-redshift galaxies may lead to systematic differences with CO-based estimates.  Based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and IGN (Spain). Based also on observations from Herschel, an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.

AB  - Galaxy interactions/mergers have been shown to dominate the population of IR-luminous galaxies (L IR >~ 1011.6 L ☉) in the local universe (z <~ 0.25). Recent studies based on the relation between galaxies' star formation rates and stellar mass (the SFR-M * relation or the "galaxy main sequence") have suggested that galaxy interaction/mergers may only become significant when galaxies fall well above the galaxy main sequence. Since the typical SFR at a given M * increases with redshift, the existence of the galaxy main sequence implies that massive, IR-luminous galaxies at high z may not necessarily be driven by galaxy interactions. We examine the role of galaxy interactions in the SFR-M * relation by carrying out a morphological analysis of 2084 Herschel-selected galaxies at 0.2 < z < 1.5 in the COSMOS field. Using a detailed visual classification scheme, we show that the fraction of "disk galaxies" decreases and the fraction of "irregular" galaxies increases systematically with increasing L IR out to z <~ 1.5 and z <~ 1.0, respectively. At L IR >1011.5  L ☉, >~ 50% of the objects show evident features of strongly interacting/merger systems, where this percentage is similar to the studies of local IR-luminous galaxies. The fraction of interacting/merger systems also systematically increases with the deviation from the SFR-M * relation, supporting the view that galaxies falling above the main sequence are more dominated by mergers than the main-sequence galaxies. Meanwhile, we find that >~ 18% of massive IR-luminous "main-sequence galaxies" are classified as interacting systems, where this population may not evolve through the evolutionary track predicted by a simple gas exhaustion model.

Splitting the star formation budget by galaxy morphology, we find that early-type galaxies (ETGs) host ˜14 per cent of the budget, while Sb/Sc galaxies host the bulk (˜53 per cent) of the local star formation activity. Recent work indicates that star formation in nearby ETGs is driven by minor mergers, implying that at least ˜14 per cent of local star formation is triggered by this process. A more accurate estimate can be derived by noting that an infalling satellite likely induces a larger starburst in a galaxy of `later' morphological type, both due to higher availability of gas in the accreting galaxy and also because a bigger bulge better stabilizes the disc against star formation. This enables us to use the star formation in ETGs to estimate a lower limit for the fraction of star formation in late-type galaxies (LTGs) that is minor-merger-driven. Using a subsample of ETGs that is mass- and environment-matched to the LTGs (implying a similar infalling satellite population), we estimate this limit to be ˜24 per cent. Thus, a lower limit for the fraction of cosmic star formation that is induced by minor mergers is ˜35 per cent [14 per cent (ETGs) + 0.24 × 86 per cent (LTGs)]. The observed positive correlation between black hole and galaxy mass further implies that a similar fraction of black hole accretion may also be triggered by minor mergers. Detailed studies of minor-merger remnants are therefore essential, to quantify the role of this important process in driving stellar mass and black hole growth in the local Universe.

AB  - We use an automated galaxy morphology analysis method to quantitatively measure the spirality of galaxies classified manually as elliptical. The data set used for the analysis consists of 60,518 galaxy images with redshift obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and classified manually by Galaxy Zoo, as well as the RC3 and NA10 catalogues. We measure the spirality of the galaxies by using the Ganalyzer method, which transforms the galaxy image to its radial intensity plot to detect galaxy spirality that is in many cases difficult to notice by manual observation of the raw galaxy image. Experimental results using manually classified elliptical and S0 galaxies with redshift <0.3 suggest that galaxies classified manually as elliptical and S0 exhibit a nonzero signal for the spirality. These results suggest that the human eye observing the raw galaxy image might not always be the most effective way of detecting spirality and curves in the arms of galaxies.

AB  - How is mass distributed in the Universe? How does it compare with the distribution of light and stars? We address these questions by examining the distribution of mass, determined from weak lensing observations, and starlight, around >105 Sloan Digital Sky Survey MaxBCG groups and clusters as a function of environment and scale, from deep inside clusters to large cosmic scales of 22 h-1 Mpc. The observed cumulative mass-to-light profile, M/L (< r), rises on small scales, reflecting the increasing M/L of the central bright galaxy of the cluster, then flattens to a nearly constant ratio on scales above ˜300 h-1 kpc, where light follows mass on all scales and in all environments. A trend of slightly decreasing M/L (r) with scale is shown to be consistent with the varying stellar population following the morphology-density relation. This suggests that stars trace mass remarkably well even though they represent only a few per cent of the total mass. We determine the stellar mass fraction and find it to be nearly constant on all scales above ˜300 h-1 kpc, with M*/Mtot ~= 0.01 $\pm$ 0.004. We further suggest that most of the dark matter in the Universe is located in the large haloes of individual galaxies (˜300 kpc for L* galaxies); we show that the entire M/L (r) profile - from groups and clusters to large-scale structure - can be accounted for by the aggregate masses of the individual galaxies (whose haloes may be stripped off but still remain in the clusters), plus gas. We use the observed M/L ratio on large scales to determine the mass density of the Universe: Omega _m = 0.24 $\pm$ 0.02 b_M/L2 = 0.26 $\pm$ 0.02.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the properties of a sample of six BL Lacs by fitting their spectra using our inhomogeneous jet model with an accelerating, magnetically dominated, parabolic base, which transitions to a slowly decelerating conical jet with a geometry based on observations of M87. Our model is able to fit very well to the simultaneous multiwavelength spectra of all the BL Lacs including radio observations. We find that the BL Lacs have lower jet powers and bulk Lorentz factors than the sample of Compton-dominant blazars investigated in Paper III, consistent with the blazar sequence. Excitingly, we find a correlation between the radius at which the jet first comes into equipartition and the jet power, in agreement with our prediction from Paper III. We interpret this result as one of two physical scenarios: a universal jet geometry which scales linearly with black hole mass or a dichotomy in Eddington accretion rates between flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacs. If we assume that the jet geometry of all blazars scales linearly with black hole mass, then we find a plausible range of masses (˜107-1010 M&sun;). We find that the quiescent gamma-ray spectrum of Markarian 421 is best fitted by scattering of external cosmic microwave background photons. We are unable to fit the spectrum using synchrotron self-Compton emission due to strong gamma-ray absorption via pair production even using a compact, rapidly decelerating, jet with a very large bulk Lorentz factor (50), as has been suggested recently. This is because the ratio of synchrotron to inverse-Compton emission requires a high density of synchrotron photons to scatter which makes the region opaque to TeV gamma-rays even with large bulk Lorentz factors. Finally, we fit to the spectral energy distributions of the four high power high synchrotron peak frequency BL Lacs recently found by Padovani et al. We find that their high peak frequency emission is caused by high maximum electron energies whilst the rest of their jet properties are typical of relatively high power BL Lacs and consistent with our predictions.

AB  - Objects and structures gravitationally decoupled from the Hubble expansion will appear to shrink in angular size as the universe expands. Observations of extragalactic proper motions can thus directly reveal the cosmic expansion. Relatively static structures such as galaxies or galaxy clusters can potentially be used to measure the Hubble constant, and test masses in large scale structures can measure the overdensity. Since recession velocities and angular separations can be precisely measured, apparent proper motions can also provide geometric distance measurements to static structures. The apparent fractional angular compression of static objects is 15 muas yr--1 in the local universe; this motion is modulated by the overdensity in dynamic expansion-decoupled structures. We use the Titov et al. quasar proper motion catalog to examine the pairwise proper motion of a sparse network of test masses. Small-separation pairs (<200 Mpc comoving) are too few to measure the expected effect, yielding an inconclusive 8.3 $\pm$ 14.9 muas yr--1. Large-separation pairs (200-1500 Mpc) show no net convergence or divergence for z < 1, --2.7 $\pm$ 3.7 muas yr--1, consistent with pure Hubble expansion and significantly inconsistent with static structures, as expected. For all pairs a "null test" gives --0.36 $\pm$ 0.62 muas yr--1, consistent with Hubble expansion and excludes a static locus at ~5-10sigma significance for z ~= 0.5-2.0. The observed large-separation pairs provide a reference frame for small-separation pairs that will significantly deviate from the Hubble flow. The current limitation is the number of small-separation objects with precise astrometry, but Gaia will address this and will likely detect the cosmic recession.

AB  - We present estimates of magnetic field strengths in the interstellar media of starburst galaxies derived from measurements of Zeeman splitting associated with OH megamasers. The results for eight galaxies with Zeeman detections suggest that the magnetic energy density in the interstellar medium of starburst galaxies is comparable to their hydrostatic gas pressure, as in the Milky Way. We discuss the significant uncertainties in this conclusion, and possible measurements that could reduce these uncertainties. We also compare the Zeeman splitting derived magnetic field estimates to magnetic field strengths estimated using synchrotron fluxes and assuming that the magnetic field and cosmic rays have comparable energy densities, known as the "minimum energy" argument. We find that the minimum energy argument systematically underestimates magnetic fields in starburst galaxies, and that the conditions that would be required to produce agreement between the minimum energy estimate and the Zeeman derived estimate of interstellar medium magnetic fields are implausible. The conclusion that magnetic fields in starburst galaxies exceed the minimum energy magnetic fields is consistent with starburst galaxies adhering to the linearity of the far-infrared-radio correlation.

AB  - In this paper, we use the Galaxy Zoo 2 data set to study the behavior of bars in disk galaxies as a function of specific star formation rate (SSFR) and bulge prominence. Our sample consists of 13,295 disk galaxies, with an overall (strong) bar fraction of 23.6% $\pm$ 0.4%, of which 1154 barred galaxies also have bar length (BL) measurements. These samples are the largest ever used to study the role of bars in galaxy evolution. We find that the likelihood of a galaxy hosting a bar is anticorrelated with SSFR, regardless of stellar mass or bulge prominence. We find that the trends of bar likelihood and BL with bulge prominence are bimodal with SSFR. We interpret these observations using state-of-the-art simulations of bar evolution that include live halos and the effects of gas and star formation. We suggest our observed trends of bar likelihood with SSFR are driven by the gas fraction of the disks, a factor demonstrated to significantly retard both bar formation and evolution in models. We interpret the bimodal relationship between bulge prominence and bar properties as being due to the complicated effects of classical bulges and central mass concentrations on bar evolution and also to the growth of disky pseudobulges by bar evolution. These results represent empirical evidence for secular evolution driven by bars in disk galaxies. This work suggests that bars are not stagnant structures within disk galaxies but are a critical evolutionary driver of their host galaxies in the local universe (z < 1).  .

AB  - Recent numerical N-body simulations of spiral galaxies have shown that spiral arms in N-body simulations do not rotate rigidly as expected in classic density wave theory, but instead seem to rotate at a similar speed to the local rotation speed of the stellar disc material. This in turn yields winding, transient and recurrent spiral structure, whose corotating nature gives rise to changes in the angular momentum (radial migration) of star particles close to the spiral arm at many radii. From high-resolution N-body simulations, we highlight the evolution of strongly migrating star particles (migrators) and star particles that do not migrate (non-migrators) around a spiral arm. We investigate the individual orbit histories of migrators and non-migrators and find that there are several types of migrator and non-migrator, each with unique radial evolution. We find the important quantities that affect the orbital evolution to be the radial and tangential velocity components in combination with the azimuthal distance to the spiral arm at the time the star particle begins to feel tangential force. We contrast each type of orbit to compare how these factors combine for migrators and non-migrators. We find that the positive (negative) migrators sustain a position behind (in front of) the spiral arm, and feel continuous tangential force as long as the spiral arm persists. This is because the positive (negative) migrators are close to the apocentre (pericentre) epicycle phase during their migration, and rotate slower (faster) than the corotating spiral arm. On the other hand, non-migrators stay close to the spiral arm, and pass or are passed by the spiral arm one or two times. Although they gain or lose the angular momentum when they are behind or in front of the spiral arm, their net angular momentum change becomes close to zero. We discuss also the long-term effects of radial migration on the radial metallicity distribution and radial angular momentum and mass profiles.

Our database includes morphology distribution as well as the structural and spectroscopic properties of each morphology type based on the recent remeasurements of spectral line strengths by Oh and collaborators. Our database does not include galaxies that are apparently smaller and flatter because morphology classification of them turned out to be difficult. Our statistics confirmed the up-to-date knowledge of galaxy populations, e.g., correlations between morphology and line strengths as well as the derived ages. We hope that this database will be useful as a reference.

AB  - Aims: We report four new 22 GHz H2O water masers found in a Green Bank Telescope search toward 37 nearby objects. Our goal was to find new maser galaxies, active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk masers, and objects where hydroxyl and water maser species coexist.  Methods: We observed 37 sources within 250 Mpc that were selected by high X-ray luminosity (LX > 1040 W) and high absorbing column density (NH ≳ 1022 cm-2). Sources included dual or triple AGN and interacting systems. We also searched objects detected in hydroxyl (OH). A catalog of 4038 known H2O (non)detections was assembled to avoid unnecessary reobservations. The final selection consisted of 16 new sources, 13 nondetections to follow up with a factor 10 higher sensitivity, 10 OH masers and 1 deep OH absorber, of which 37 were observed.  Results: Water megamasers were detected towards the Sy 2 galaxy 2MFGC 13581, towards the 6 GHz OH absorber NGC 4261 and towards the two 1.6 GHz OH maser sources IRAS 17526+3253 and IRAS 20550+1656. We set upper limits on 33 nondetections. The detection rate was 25% in OH galaxies and 11% overall. The mean sensitivity was 4 mJy over 24.4 kHz (0.31 km s-1) or between 0.1 L&sun; and 1.0 L&sun; rms for the distances covered by the source sample. Combined with other searches, a total of 95 objects have now been searched for both OH and H2O masers.  Conclusions: The maser features in 2MFGC 13581 are typical of a sub-parsec accretion disk, whereas NGC 4261 likely has jet masers in a masing torus. The NGC 4261 galaxy (3C 270; dusty torus, twin jet) and its masers appear similar to NGC 1052, where continuum seed emission by a twin jet supports masers in the torus. Imaging with very long baseline interferometry is required to determine the masing regions in NGC 4261 and 2MFGC 13581. IRAS 17526+3253 has narrow 350 L&sun; systemic masers, and the tentative 5sigma detection in IRAS 20550+1656 (II Zw 96) strongly resembles massive star formation kilomasers in NGC 2146. The latter two detections increase to eight the number of known "dual-species" objects containing both OH and H2O masers. Further, we found the overall dual-species detection rate (8 in 95) to be of the order of the joint probability of both species independently occurring in the same object (1% lower bound). However, this needs to be verified by a more detailed analysis that accounts for the individual selection criteria of the 95 searched objects. Lastly, we see a lack of H2O kilomasers in OH megamaser objects, which was previously noted. This may be due to sensitivity bias rather than for astrophysical reasons.

AB  - We report the discovery of 14 new transiting planet candidates in the Kepler field from the Planet Hunters citizen science program. None of these candidates overlap with Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs), and five of the candidates were missed by the Kepler Transit Planet Search (TPS) algorithm. The new candidates have periods ranging from 124-904 days, eight residing in their host star's habitable zone (HZ) and two (now) in multiple planet systems. We report the discovery of one more addition to the six planet candidate system around KOI-351, marking the first seven planet candidate system from Kepler. Additionally, KOI-351 bears some resemblance to our own solar system, with the inner five planets ranging from Earth to mini-Neptune radii and the outer planets being gas giants; however, this system is very compact, with all seven planet candidates orbiting $\lesssim 1$ AU from their host star. We perform a numerical integration of the orbits and show that the system remains stable for over 100 million years. A Hill stability test also confirms the feasibility for the dynamical stability of the KOI-351 system.

AB  - With a goal toward deriving the physical conditions in external galaxies, we present a study of the ammonia (NH3) emission and absorption in a sample of star-forming systems. Using the unique sensitivities to kinetic temperature afforded by the excitation characteristics of several inversion transitions of NH3, we have continued our characterization of the dense gas in star-forming galaxies by measuring the kinetic temperature in a sample of 23 galaxies and one galaxy offset position selected for their high infrared luminosity. We derive kinetic temperatures toward 13 galaxies, 9 of which possess multiple kinetic temperature and/or velocity components. Eight of these galaxies exhibit kinetic temperatures >100 K, which are in many cases at least a factor of two larger than kinetic temperatures derived previously. Furthermore, the derived kinetic temperatures in our galaxy sample, which are in many cases at least a factor of two larger than derived dust temperatures, point to a problem with the common assumption that dust and gas kinetic temperatures are equivalent. As previously suggested, the use of dust emission at wavelengths greater than 160 mum to derive dust temperatures, or dust heating from older stellar populations, may be skewing derived dust temperatures in these galaxies to lower values. We confirm the detection of high-excitation OH 2Pi3/2 J = 9/2 absorption toward Arp 220. We also report the first detections of non-metastable NH3 inversion transitions toward external galaxies in the (2,1) (NGC 253, NGC 660, IC 342, and IC 860), (3,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4) (all in NGC 660), and (10,9) (Arp 220) transitions.

Here we compared the color of 64,399 spiral galaxies that spin clockwise to 63,215 spiral galaxies that spin counterclockwise. The results show that clockwise galaxies tend to be bluer than galaxies that spin counterclockwise. The probability that the color differences can be attributed to chance is ~0.019.

AB  - We present the results of a combined galaxy population analysis for the host galaxies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) identified at 0 < z < 1.4 within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Boötes, and DEEP2 surveys. We identified AGN in a uniform and unbiased manner at X-ray, infrared, and radio wavelengths. Supermassive black holes undergoing radiatively efficient accretion (detected as X-ray and/or infrared AGN) appear to be hosted in a separate and distinct galaxy population than AGN undergoing powerful mechanically dominated accretion (radio AGN). Consistent with some previous studies, radiatively efficient AGN appear to be preferentially hosted in modest star-forming galaxies, with little dependence on AGN or galaxy luminosity. AGN exhibiting radio-emitting jets due to mechanically dominated accretion are almost exclusively observed in massive, passive galaxies. Crucially, we now provide strong evidence that the observed host-galaxy trends are independent of redshift. In particular, these different accretion-mode AGN have remained as separate galaxy populations throughout the last 9 Gyr. Furthermore, it appears that galaxies hosting AGN have evolved along the same path as galaxies that are not hosting AGN with little evidence for distinctly separate evolution.

AB  - We present a catalog of bulge, disk, and total stellar mass estimates for ~660,000 galaxies in the Legacy area of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data (SDSS) Release 7. These masses are based on a homogeneous catalog of g- and r-band photometry described by Simard et al., which we extend here with bulge+disk and Sérsic profile photometric decompositions in the SDSS u, i, and z bands. We discuss the methodology used to derive stellar masses from these data via fitting to broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and show that the typical statistical uncertainty on total, bulge, and disk stellar mass is ~0.15 dex. Despite relatively small formal uncertainties, we argue that SED modeling assumptions, including the choice of synthesis model, extinction law, initial mass function, and details of stellar evolution likely contribute an additional 60% systematic uncertainty in any mass estimate based on broadband SED fitting. We discuss several approaches for identifying genuine bulge+disk systems based on both their statistical likelihood and an analysis of their one-dimensional surface-brightness profiles, and include these metrics in the catalogs. Estimates of the total, bulge and disk stellar masses for both normal and dust-free models and their uncertainties are made publicly available here.

We found that the best algorithms improved on the benchmark code, LENSTOOL by > 30% and could measure the positions of > 3x10^14MSun halos to less than 5'' and < 10^14MSun to within 1'.

AB  - Astronomy and related fields are at the forefront of science and technology; answering fundamental questions and driving innovation. Although blue-skies research like astronomy rarely contributes directly with tangible outcomes on a short time scale, the pursuit of this research requires cutting-edge technology and methods that can on a longer time scale, through their broader application make a difference. A wealth of examples show how the study of astronomy contributes to technology, economy and society by constantly pushing for instruments, processes and software that are beyond our current capabilities. In this essay we outline both the tangible and intangible reasons that astronomy is an important part of society. Although we have focused mainly on the technology and knowledge transfer, perhaps the most important contribution is still the fact that astronomy makes us aware of how we fit into the vast Universe.

AB  - We present an analysis of the large-scale structure of the halo of the Andromeda galaxy, based on the Pan-Andromeda Archeological Survey (PAndAS), currently the most complete map of resolved stellar populations in any galactic halo. Despite the presence of copious substructures, the global halo populations follow closely power-law profiles that become steeper with increasing metallicity. We divide the sample into stream-like populations and a smooth halo component (defined as the population that cannot be resolved into spatially distinct substructures with PAndAS). Fitting a three-dimensional halo model reveals that the most metal-poor populations ([Fe/H] \lt -1.7) are distributed approximately spherically (slightly prolate with ellipticity c/a = 1.09 $\pm$ 0.03), with only a relatively small fraction residing in discernible stream-like structures (f stream = 42%). The sphericity of the ancient smooth component strongly hints that the dark matter halo is also approximately spherical. More metal-rich populations contain higher fractions of stars in streams, with f stream becoming as high as 86% for [Fe/H] \gt -0.6. The space density of the smooth metal-poor component has a global power-law slope of gamma = --3.08 $\pm$ 0.07, and a non-parametric fit shows that the slope remains nearly constant from 30 kpc to ~300 kpc. The total stellar mass in the halo at distances beyond 2$\,^\circ$ is ~1.1 × 1010 M ☉, while that of the smooth component is ~3 × 109 M ☉. Extrapolating into the inner galaxy, the total stellar mass of the smooth halo is plausibly ~8 × 109 M ☉. We detect a substantial metallicity gradient, which declines from lang[Fe/H]rang = --0.7 at R = 30 kpc to lang[Fe/H]rang = --1.5 at R = 150 kpc for the full sample, with the smooth halo being ~0.2 dex more metal poor than the full sample at each radius. While qualitatively in line with expectations from cosmological simulations, these observations are of great importance as they provide a prototype template that such simulations must now be able to reproduce in quantitative detail.  Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institute National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.

AB  - An analysis of more than 3000 galaxies resolved at better than 114 h--1 pc at z = 0.62 in a "LAOZI" cosmological adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulation is performed and insights are gained on star formation quenching and color migration. The vast majority of red galaxies are found to be within three virial radii of a larger galaxy at the onset of quenching, when the specific star formation rate experiences the sharpest decline to fall below ~10--2-10--1 Gyr--1 (depending on the redshift). Thus, we shall call this mechanism "environment quenching," which encompasses satellite quenching. Two physical processes are largely responsible: Ram pressure stripping first disconnects the galaxy from the cold gas supply on large scales, followed by a longer period of cold gas starvation taking place in a high velocity-dispersion environment, in which during the early part of the process, the existing dense cold gas in the central region (<=10 kpc) is consumed by in situ star formation. On average, quenching is found to be more efficient (i.e., a larger fraction of galaxies being quenched) but not faster (i.e., the duration being weakly dependent on the environment) in a denser environment. Throughout this quenching period and the ensuing one in the red sequence, galaxies follow nearly vertical tracks in the color-stellar mass diagram. In contrast, individual galaxies of all masses grow most of their stellar masses in the blue cloud, prior to the onset of quenching, and progressively more massive blue galaxies with already relatively older mean stellar ages continue to enter the red sequence. Consequently, correlations among observables of red galaxies---such as the age-mass relation--- are largely inherited from their blue progenitors at the onset of quenching. While the color makeup of the entire galaxy population strongly depends on the environment, which is a direct result of environment quenching, physical properties of blue galaxies as a subpopulation show little dependence on the environment. A variety of predictions from the simulation are shown to be in accordance with extant observations.

AB  - `Conspiracy' between the dark and the baryonic matter prohibits an unambiguous decomposition of disc galaxy rotation curves into the corresponding components. Several methods have been proposed to counter this difficulty, but their results are widely discrepant. In this paper, I revisit one of these methods, which relies on the relation between the halo density and the decrease of the bar pattern speed. The latter is routinely characterized by the ratio R of the corotation radius RCR to the bar length Lb, R = R_CR/L_b. I use a set of N-body+SPH simulations, including subgrid physics, whose initial conditions cover a range of gas fractions and halo shapes. The models, by construction, have roughly the same azimuthally averaged circular velocity curve and halo density and they are all submaximal, i.e. according to previous works, they are expected to have all roughly the same R value, well outside the fast bar range (1.2 $\pm$ 0.2). Contrary to these expectations, however, these simulations end up having widely different R values, either within the fast bar range or well outside it. This shows that the R value cannot constrain the halo density, nor determine whether galactic discs are maximal or submaximal. I argue that this is true even for early-type discs (S0s and Sas).

AB  - The onset of spiral structure in galaxies appears to occur between redshifts 1.4 and 1.8 when disks have developed a cool stellar component, rotation dominates over turbulent motions in the gas, and massive clumps become less frequent. During the transition from clumpy to spiral disks, two unusual types of spirals are found in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field that are massive, clumpy, and irregular like their predecessor clumpy disks, yet spiral-like or sheared like their descendants. One type is "woolly" with massive clumpy arms all over the disk and is brighter than other disk galaxies at the same redshift, while another type has irregular multiple arms with high pitch angles, star formation knots, and no inner symmetry like today's multiple-arm galaxies. The common types of spirals seen locally are also present in a redshift range around z ~ 1, namely grand design with two symmetric arms, multiple arm with symmetry in the inner parts and several long, thin arms in the outer parts, and flocculent, with short, irregular, and patchy arms that are mostly from star formation. Normal multiple-arm galaxies are found only closer than z ~ 0.6 in the Ultra Deep Field. Grand design galaxies extend furthest to z ~ 1.8, presumably because interactions can drive a two-arm spiral in a disk that would otherwise have a more irregular structure. The difference between these types is understandable in terms of the usual stability parameters for gas and stars, and the ratio of the velocity dispersion to rotation speed.

AB  - We investigate the morphology dependence of the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation, and the expansion of the relation into a three-dimensional manifold defined by luminosity, total circular velocity and a third dynamical parameter, to fully characterize spiral galaxies across all morphological types. We use a full semi-analytic hierarchical model (based on Croton et al.), built on cosmological simulations of structure formation, to model galaxy evolution and build the theoretical TF relation. With this tool, we analyse a unique data set of galaxies for which we cross-match luminosity with total circular velocity and central velocity dispersion. We provide a theoretical framework to calculate such measurable quantities from hierarchical semi-analytic models. We establish the morphology dependence of the TF relation in both model and data. We analyse the dynamical properties of the model galaxies and determine that the parameter sigma/VC, i.e. the ratio between random and total motions defined by velocity dispersion and circular velocity, accurately characterizes the varying slope of the TF relation for different model galaxy types. We apply these dynamical cuts to the observed galaxies and find indeed that such selection produces a differential slope of the TF relation. The TF slope in different ranges of sigma/VC is consistent with that for the traditional photometric classification in Sa, Sb and Sc. We conclude that sigma/VC is a good parameter to classify galaxy type, and we argue that such classification based on dynamics more closely mirrors the physical properties of the observed galaxies, compared to visual (photometric) classification. We also argue that dynamical classification is useful for samples where eye inspection is not reliable or impractical. We conclude that sigma/VC is a suitable parameter to characterize the hierarchical assembly history that determines the disc-to-bulge ratio, and to expand the TF relation into a three-dimensional manifold, defined by luminosity, circular velocity and sigma/VC.

AB  - Gravitationally bound three-body systems have been studied for hundreds of years and are common in our Galaxy. They show complex orbital interactions, which can constrain the compositions, masses and interior structures of the bodies and test theories of gravity, if sufficiently precise measurements are available. A triple system containing a radio pulsar could provide such measurements, but the only previously known such system, PSRB1620-26 (refs 7, 8; with a millisecond pulsar, a white dwarf, and a planetary-mass object in an orbit of several decades), shows only weak interactions. Here we report precision timing and multiwavelength observations of PSRJ0337+1715, a millisecond pulsar in a hierarchical triple system with two other stars. Strong gravitational interactions are apparent and provide the masses of the pulsar (1.4378(13), where  is the solar mass and the parentheses contain the uncertainty in the final decimal places) and the two white dwarf companions (0.19751(15) and 0.4101(3)), as well as the inclinations of the orbits (both about 39.2$\,^\circ$). The unexpectedly coplanar and nearly circular orbits indicate a complex and exotic evolutionary past that differs from those of known stellar systems. The gravitational field of the outer white dwarf strongly accelerates the inner binary containing the neutron star, and the system will thus provide an ideal laboratory in which to test the strong equivalence principle of general relativity.

AB  - The effective extinction law (attenuation behavior) in galaxies in the emitted ultraviolet (UV) regime is well known only for actively star-forming objects and combines effects of the grain properties, fine structure in the dust distribution, and relative distributions of stars and dust. We use Galaxy Evolution Explorer, XMM Optical Monitor, and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data to explore the UV attenuation in the outer parts of spiral disks which are backlit by other UV-bright galaxies, starting with the candidate list of pairs provided by Galaxy Zoo participants. New optical images help to constrain the geometry and structure of the target galaxies. Our analysis incorporates galaxy symmetry, using non-overlapping regions of each galaxy to derive error estimates on the attenuation measurements. The entire sample has an attenuation law across the optical and UV that is close to the Calzetti et al. form; the UV slope for the overall sample is substantially shallower than found by Wild et al., which is a reasonable match to the more distant galaxies in our sample but not to the weighted combination including NGC 2207. The nearby, bright spiral NGC 2207 alone gives an accuracy almost equal to the rest of our sample, and its outer arms have a very low level of foreground starlight. Thus, this widespread, fairly "gray" law can be produced from the distribution of dust alone, without a necessary contribution from differential escape of stars from dense clouds. Our results indicate that the extrapolation needed to compare attenuation between backlit galaxies at moderate redshifts from HST data, and local systems from Sloan Digital Sky Survey and similar data, is mild enough to allow the use of galaxy overlaps to trace the cosmic history of dust in galaxies. For NGC 2207, HST data in the near-UV F336W band show that the covering factor of clouds with small optical attenuation becomes a dominant factor farther into the UV, which opens the possibility that widespread diffuse dust dominates over dust in star-forming regions deep into the UV. Comparison with published radiative-transfer models indicates that the role of dust clumping dominates over differences in grain populations at this coarse spatial resolution.

AB  - We report the morphological classification of 3727 galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey with Mr < -17.4 mag and in the redshift range 0.025 < z < 0.06 (2.1 × 105 Mpc3) into E, S0-Sa, SB0-SBa, Sab-Scd, SBab-SBcd, Sd-Irr and little blue spheroid classes. Approximately 70 per cent of galaxies in our sample are disc-dominated systems, with the remaining ˜30 per cent spheroid dominated. We establish the robustness of our classifications, and use them to derive morphological-type luminosity functions and luminosity densities in the ugrizYJHK passbands, improving on prior studies that split by global colour or light profile shape alone. We find that the total galaxy luminosity function is best described by a double-Schechter function while the constituent morphological-type luminosity functions are well described by a single-Schechter function. These data are also used to derive the star formation rate densities for each Hubble class, and the attenuated and unattenuated (corrected for dust) cosmic spectral energy distributions, i.e. the instantaneous energy production budget. While the observed optical/near-IR energy budget is dominated 58:42 by galaxies with a significant spheroidal component, the actual energy production rate is reversed, i.e. the combined disc-dominated populations generate ˜1.3 times as much energy as the spheroid-dominated populations. On the grandest scale, this implies that chemical evolution in the local Universe is currently largely confined to mid-type spiral classes like our Milky Way.

AB  - We measure the redshift evolution of the bar fraction in a sample of 2380 visually selected disc galaxies found in Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. The visual classifications used both to identify the disc sample and to indicate the presence of stellar bars were provided by citizen scientists via the Galaxy Zoo: Hubble (GZH) project. We find that the overall bar fraction decreases by a factor of 2, from 22 $\pm$ 5 per cent at z = 0.4 (tlb = 4.2 Gyr) to 11 $\pm$ 2 per cent at z = 1.0 (tlb = 7.8 Gyr), consistent with previous analysis. We show that this decrease, of the strong bar fraction in a volume limited sample of massive disc galaxies [stellar mass limit of log (M*/M&sun;) >= 10.0], cannot be due to redshift-dependent biases hiding either bars or disc galaxies at higher redshifts. Splitting our sample into three bins of mass we find that the decrease in bar fraction is most prominent in the highest mass bin, while the lower mass discs in our sample show a more modest evolution. We also include a sample of 98 red disc galaxies. These galaxies have a high bar fraction (45 $\pm$ 5 per cent), and are missing from other COSMOS samples which used SED fitting or colours to identify high-redshift discs. Our results are consistent with a picture in which the evolution of massive disc galaxies begins to be affected by slow (secular) internal process at z ˜ 1. We discuss possible connections of the decrease in bar fraction to the redshift, including the growth of stable disc galaxies, mass evolution of the gas content in disc galaxies, as well as the mass-dependent effects of tidal interactions.

AB  - We use a new telescope concept, the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, to study the low surface brightness outskirts of the spiral galaxy M101. The radial surface brightness profile is measured down to mu g  ~ 32 mag arcsec--2, a depth that approaches the sensitivity of star count studies in the Local Group. We convert surface brightness to surface mass density using the radial g -- r color profile. The mass density profile shows no significant upturn at large radius and is well-approximated by a simple bulge + disk model out to R = 70 kpc, corresponding to 18 disk scale lengths. Fitting a bulge + disk + halo model we find that the best-fitting halo mass M_halo = 1.7_-1.7^+3.4 \times 10^8 M ☉. The total stellar mass of M101 is M_tot,*= 5.3_-1.3^+1.7 \times 10^10 M ☉, and we infer that the halo mass fraction f_halo=M_halo/M_tot,*= 0.003^+0.006_-0.003. This mass fraction is lower than that of the Milky Way (f halo ~ 0.02) and M31 (f halo ~ 0.04). All three galaxies fall below the f halo-M tot, * relation predicted by recent cosmological simulations that trace the light of disrupted satellites, with M101's halo mass a factor of ~10 below the median expectation. However, the predicted scatter in this relation is large, and more galaxies are needed to better quantify this possible tension with galaxy formation models. Dragonfly is well suited for this project: as integrated-light surface brightness is independent of distance, large numbers of galaxies can be studied in a uniform way.

AB  - We develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dust attenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. It is based on two stellar absorption-line indices, the 4000-Å break strength and the Balmer absorption-line index HdeltaA. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad-band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95 per cent confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +/-40 per cent. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric passband and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000-Å break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have, to within a factor of approximately 2, stellar masses ~5× 1010Msolar, half-light radii ~3 kpc and half-light surface mass densities ~109 Msolar kpc-2. The distribution of Dn(4000) is strongly bimodal, showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populations and galaxies with more recent star formation.

AB  - We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of ~ 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* > 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-Åbreak (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.

AB  - Using the cosmological baryonic accretion rate and normal star formation (SF) efficiencies, we present a very simple model for star-forming galaxies that accounts for the mass and redshift dependences of the star formation rate (SFR)-mass and Tully-Fisher (TF) relations from z ~ 2 to the present. The time evolution follows from the fact that each modeled galaxy approaches a steady state where the SFR follows the (net) cold gas accretion rate. The key feature of the model is a halo mass floor M min ~= 1011 M sun below which accretion is quenched in order to simultaneously account for the observed slopes of the SFR-mass and TF relations. The same successes cannot be achieved via an SF threshold (or delay) nor by varying the SF efficiency or the feedback efficiency. Combined with the mass ceiling for cold accretion due to virial shock heating, the mass floor M min explains galaxy "downsizing," where more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorter period of time. It turns out that the model also accounts for the observed galactic baryon and gas fractions as a function of mass and time, and the cosmic SFR density, which are all resulting from the mass floor M min. The model helps us to understand that it is the cosmological decline of accretion rate that drives the decrease of cosmic SFR density between z ~ 2 and z = 0 and the rise of the cosmic SFR density from z ~ 6 to z ~ 2 that allows us to put a constraint on our main parameter M min ~= 1011 M sun. Among the physical mechanisms that could be responsible for the mass floor, our view is that photoionization feedback (from first in situ hot stars) lowering the cooling efficiency is likely to play a large role.

AB  - Given an approximately centered image of a spiral galaxy, we describe an entirely automated method that finds, centers, and sizes the galaxy and then automatically extracts structural information about the spiral arms. For each arm segment found, we list the pixels in that segment and perform a least-squares fit of a logarithmic spiral arc to the pixels in the segment. The algorithm takes about 1 minute per galaxy, and can easily be scaled using parallelism. We have run it on all ~644,000 Sloan objects classified as "galaxy" and large enough to observe some structure. Our algorithm is stable in the sense that the statistics across a large sample of galaxies vary smoothly based on algorithmic parameters, although results for individual galaxies can sometimes vary in a non-smooth but easily understood manner. We find a very good correlation between our quantitative description of spiral structure and the qualitative description provided by humans via Galaxy Zoo. In addition, we find that pitch angle often varies significantly segment-to-segment in a single spiral galaxy, making it difficult to define "the" pitch angle for a single galaxy. Finally, we point out how complex arm structure (even of long arms) can lead to ambiguity in defining what an "arm" is, leading us to prefer the term "arm segments".

AB  - We have used 4000 \AA\ break and H$\delta_A$ indices in combination with SFR/M* derived from emission line flux measurements, to constrain the recent star formation histories of galaxies with stellar masses in the range 10**8-10**10 Msol. The fraction of the total SFR density in galaxies with ongoing bursts is a strong function of stellar mass, declining from 0.85 at a stellar mass of 10**8 Msol to 0.25 for galaxies with M* = 10**10 Msol. Low mass galaxies are not all young. The distribution of half mass formation times for galaxies with stellar masses less than 10**9 Msol is broad, spanning the range 1-10 Gyr. The peak-to-trough variation in star formation rate among the bursting population ranges lies in the range 10-25. In low mass galaxies, the average duration of the burst is comparable to the dynamical time of the galaxy. Galaxy structure is correlated with estimated burst mass fraction, but in different ways in low and in high mass galaxies. High mass galaxies with large burst mass fractions are more centrally concentrated, indicating that bulge formation is at work. In low mass galaxies, stellar surface mass densities decrease as a function of F_burst. These results are in good agreement with the observational predictions of Teyssier et al (2013) and lend further credence to the idea that the cuspy halo problem can be solved by energy input from multiple starbursts over the lifetime of the galaxy. We note that there is no compelling evidence for IMF variations in the population of star-forming galaxies in the local Universe.

AB  - We present a catalog of bulgeless galaxies, which includes 19,225 objects selected in four of the deepest, largest multi-wavelength data sets available---COSMOS, AEGIS, GEMS, and GOODS---at intermediate redshift (0.4 <= z <= 1.0). The morphological classification was provided by the Advanced Camera for Surveys General Catalog (ACS-GC), which used publicly available data obtained with the ACS instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope. Rest-frame photometric quantities were derived using kcorrect. We analyze the properties of the sample and the evolution of pure-disk systems with redshift. Very massive [log (M sstarf/M ☉) > 10.5] bulgeless galaxies contribute to ~30% of the total galaxy population number density at z >= 0.7, but their number density drops substantially with decreasing redshift. We show that only a negligible fraction of pure disks appear to be quiescent systems, and red sequence bulgeless galaxies show indications of dust-obscured star formation. X-ray catalogs were used to search for X-ray emission within our sample. After visual inspection and detailed parametric morphological fitting we identify 30 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that reside in galaxies without a classical bulge. The finding of such peculiar objects at intermediate redshift shows that while AGN growth in merger-free systems is a rare event (0.2% AGN hosts in this sample of bulgeless galaxies), it can indeed happen relatively early in the history of the universe.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Our current view of galaxies considers them as systems of stars and gas embedded in extended halos of dark matter, much of it formed by the infall of smaller systems at earlier times. The true extent of a galaxy remains poorly determined, with the virial radius (R_vir) providing a characteristic separation between collapsed structures in dynamical equilibrium and external infalling matter. Other physical estimates of the extent of gravitational influence include the gravitational radius, gas accretion radius, and "galactopause" arising from outflows that stall at 100-200 kpc over a range of outflow parameters and confining gas pressures. Physical criteria are proposed to define bound structures, including a more realistic definition of R_vir (M*, M_h, z_a) for stellar mass M* and halo mass M_h, half of which formed at "assembly redshifts" z_a = 0.7-1.3. We estimate the extent of bound gas and dark matter around L* galaxies to be ~200 kpc. The new virial radii, with mean R_vir ~ 200 kpc, are 40-50% smaller than values estimated in recent HST/COS detections of H I and O VI absorbers around galaxies. In the new formalism, the Milky Way stellar mass, log M* = 10.7 +/- 0.1, would correspond to R_vir = 153 (+25,-16) kpc for half-mass halo assembly at z_a = 1.06 +/- 0.03. The frequency per unit redshift of low-redshift O VI absorption lines in QSO spectra suggests absorber sizes ~150 kpc when related to intervening 0.1L* galaxies. This formalism is intended to clarify semantic differences arising from observations of extended gas in galactic halos, circumgalactic medium (CGM), and filaments of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Astronomers should refer to bound gas in the galactic halo or CGM, and unbound gas at the CGM-IGM interface, on its way into the IGM.

AB  - The processes that trigger Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) remain poorly understood. While lower luminosity AGN may be triggered by minor disturbances to the host galaxy, stronger disturbances are likely required to trigger luminous AGN. Major wet mergers of galaxies are ideal environments for AGN triggering since they provide large gas supplies and galaxy scale torques. There is however little observational evidence for a strong connection between AGN and major mergers. We analyse the morphological properties of AGN host galaxies as a function of AGN and host galaxy luminosity and compare them to a carefully matched sample of control galaxies. AGN are X-ray selected in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 0.8 and have luminosities 41 < log(L_X [erg/s]) < 44.5. 'Fake AGN' are simulated in the control galaxies by adding point sources with the magnitude of the matched AGN. We find that AGN host and control galaxies have comparable assymetries, Sersic indices and ellipticities at restframe ~950nm. AGN host galaxies show neither higher average asymmetries nor higher fractions of very disturbed objects. There is no increase in the prevalence of merger signatures with AGN luminosity. At 95% confidence we find that major mergers are responsible for <6% of all AGN in our sample as well as <40% of the highest luminosity AGN log(L_X [erg/s]) ~ 43.5). Major mergers therefore either play only a very minor role in the triggering of AGN in the luminosity range studied or time delays are too long for merger features to remain visible.

AB  - In contrast to massive, bulge hosting galaxies, very few supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are known in either low mass, or bulgeless galaxies. Such a population could provide clues to the origins of SMBHs and to secular pathways for their growth. Using the all-sky Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) survey, and bulge-to-disk decompositions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7, we report the discovery of a population of local (z<0.3) bulgeless disk galaxies with extremely red mid-infrared colors highly suggestive of a dominant active galactic nucleus (AGN), despite having no optical AGN signatures in their SDSS spectra. Using various mid-infrared selection criteria from the literature, there are between 30 to over 300 bulgeless galaxies with possible AGNs. Other known scenarios that can heat the dust to high temperatures do not appear to explain the observed colors of this sample. If these galaxies are confirmed to host AGNs, this study will provide a breakthrough in characterizing the properties of SMBHs in the low bulge mass regime and in understanding their relation with their host galaxies. Mid-infrared selection identifies AGNs that dominate their host galaxy's emission and therefore reveal a different AGN population than is uncovered by optical studies. We find that the fraction of all galaxies identified as candidate AGNs by WISE is highest at lower stellar masses and drops dramatically in higher mass galaxies, in striking contrast to the findings from optical studies.

AB  - Critical insights on galaxy evolution stem from the study of bars. With the advent of HST surveys that trace bars in the rest-frame optical out to z~1, it is critical to provide a reference baseline for bars at z~0 in the optical band. We present results on bars at z~0 in the optical and NIR based on 180 spirals from OSUBSGS. (1) The deprojected bar fraction at z~0 is ~60%+/-7% in the NIR and ~44%+/-7% in the optical. (2) The results before and after deprojection are similar, which is encouraging for high-redshift studies that forego deprojection. (3) Studies of bars at z~0.2-1.0 (look-back time 3-8 Gyr) report an optical bar fraction of 30%+/-6%, after applying cutoffs in absolute magnitude (MV<-19.3), bar size (abar>=1.5 kpc), and bar ellipticity (ebar>=0.4). Applying these exact cutoffs to the OSUBSGS data yields a comparable optical bar fraction at z~0 of ~34%+/-7%. This rules out scenarios in which the optical bar fraction in bright disks declines strongly with redshift. (4) Most (~70%) bars have moderate to high ellipticity. There is no bimodality in the distribution of ebar. The H-band bar fraction and ebar show no substantial variation across RC3 Hubble types Sa to Scd. (5) RC3 bar types should be used with caution. Many galaxies with RC3 types AB are unbarred, and RC3 bar classes B and AB have a significant overlap in ebar. (6) Most bars have sizes below 5 kpc. Bar and disk sizes correlate, and most bars have abar/R25 in the range ~0.1-0.5. This suggests that the growths of bars and disks are intimately tied.

AB  - We have measured the fraction of bars in nearby spiral galaxies using near-infrared J, H, and Ks images of 151 spiral galaxies from 2MASS. This local sample provides an anchor for the study of the evolution of the bar fraction and bar properties with redshift. We identify bars by analyzing the full two-dimensional light distribution and requiring a combined ellipticity and position angle signature. The combined ``bar signature'' is found in 59% of the galaxies. The bar fraction increases to 67% when we include ``candidate'' bars, where only the ellipticity signature is present. We also measure the change in the bar fraction as a function of bar size; the bar fraction drops to 31% for bars with a semimajor axis larger than 4 kpc. We find that infrared bars typically extend to one-third of the galactic disk, with a deprojected relative size of bar/R25>~0.3+/-0.2. Early-type spirals host significantly larger bars, consistent with earlier studies. The bar/R25> is 2 times larger in early types than in late types. The typical bar axial ratio (b/a) is ~0.5, with a weak trend of higher axial ratios for larger bars.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - We describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), a seven-year sky survey which began in 2005 May. UKIDSS is being carried out using the UKIRT Wide Field Camera (WFCAM), which has the largest étendue of any infrared astronomical instrument to date. It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H2. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000deg2 to a depth of K ~ 18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35deg2 to K ~ 21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77deg2 to K ~ 23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long-term astronomical legacy data base; the design is, however, driven by a series of specific goals - for example, to find the nearest and faintest substellar objects, to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist, to determine the substellar mass function, to break the z = 7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionization, to measure the growth of structure from z = 3 to the present day, to determine the epoch of spheroid formation, and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed. Images and catalogues are being made available through a fully queryable user interface - the WFCAM Science Archive (http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). The data are being released in stages. The data are immediately public to astronomers in all ESO member states, and available to the world after 18 months. Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortia collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release, we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.

AB  - Using basic physical arguments, we derive by dimensional and physical analysis the characteristic masses and sizes of important objects in the Universe in terms of just a few fundamental constants. This exercise illustrates the unifying power of physics and the profound connections between the small and the large in the Cosmos we inhabit. We focus on the minimum and maximum masses of normal stars, the corresponding quantities for neutron stars, the maximum mass of a rocky planet, the maximum mass of a white dwarf, and the mass of a typical galaxy. To zeroth order, we show that all these masses can be expressed in terms of either the Planck mass or the Chandrasekar mass, in combination with various dimensionless quantities. With these examples we expose the deep interrelationships imposed by Nature between disparate realms of the Universe and the amazing consequences of the unifying character of physical law.

In just the past few years, hundreds of scholarly papers and reports have been written on questions of data sharing, data provenance, research reproducibility, licensing, attribution, privacy, and more, but our goal here is not to review that literature. Instead, we present a short guide intended for researchers who want to know why it is important to "care for and feed" data, with some practical advice on how to do that.

Narrow-line radio galaxies in the visible and UV, the source of ionization and excitation of the emission lines, emission-line luminosities, morphology of the line-emitting gas, physical properties and energetics, kinematics of the line-emitting gas, and implications from the emission lines are discussed. The morphologies and environments of the host galaxies, the alignment effect, and spectral energy distributions and ages are also examined.

AB  - The observational properties of extragalactic radio sources of sizes comparable with or greater than a typical galactic diameter and intrinsic luminosities at 408 MHz greater than 10 to the 23rd W/Hz are discussed. Following a survey of the major instrumental and observational techniques developed over the last three decades for the measurement of source structure, classes of radio structure that are commonly observed, including narrow edge-brightened and -darkened double sources, narrow- and wide-tailed sources and cluster halos, are described, and various taxonomic sequences of these morphologies are discussed. Means by which such physical properties as the energetics, confinement parameters, magnetic fields, sites of electron acceleration and rotation are derived from intensity and polarization distribution measurements are examined, and the observed characteristics of the various components of extended radio sources are considered in detail, including diffuse emission regions, hot spots, cores and jets. Finally, relationships of radio source morphologies to the properties of the parent galaxies and clusters are reviewed, and a model of the radio-source phenomenon is proposed.

AB  - We have conducted sensitive (1 sigma < 30 muJy) 1.4 GHz radio observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array of a field largely coincident with infrared observations of the Spitzer Wide-Area Extragalactic Survey. The field is centered on the European Large Area ISO Survey S1 region and has a total area of 3.9$\,^\circ$. We describe the observations and calibration, source extraction, and cross-matching to infrared sources. Two catalogs are presented: one of the radio components found in the image and another of radio sources with counterparts in the infrared and extracted from the literature. 1366 radio components were grouped into 1276 sources, 1183 of which were matched to infrared sources. We discover 31 radio sources with no infrared counterpart at all, adding to the class of Infrared-Faint Radio Sources.

AB  - We present the first results from the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey, which consists of deep radio observations of a 3.7 deg2 field surrounding the Chandra Deep Field-South, largely coincident with the infrared Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic (SWIRE) Survey. We also list cross-identifications to infrared and optical photometry data from SWIRE, and ground-based optical spectroscopy. A total of 784 radio components are identified, corresponding to 726 distinct radio sources, nearly all of which are identified with SWIRE sources. Of the radio sources with measured redshifts, most lie in the redshift range 0.5-2 and include both star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei. We identify a rare population of infrared-faint radio sources that are bright at radio wavelengths but are not seen in the available optical, infrared, or X-ray data. Such rare classes of sources can only be discovered in wide, deep surveys such as this.

AB  - We use recent proper motion measurements of the tangential velocity of M31, along with its radial velocity and distance, to derive the likelihood of the sum of halo masses of the Milky Way and M31. This is done using a sample halo pairs in the Bolshoi cosmological simulation of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology selected to match properties and environment of the Local Group. The resulting likelihood gives estimate of the sum of masses of $M_\rm MW,200+M_\rm M31,200=$ $2.40_-1.05^+1.95\times10^12\,M_\odot$ ($90\$ confidence interval). This estimate is consistent with individual mass estimates for the Milky Way and M31 and is consistent, albeit somewhat on the low side, with the mass estimated using the timing argument. We show that although the timing argument is unbiased on average for all pairs, for pairs constrained to have radial and tangential velocities similar to that of the Local Group the argument overestimates the sum of masses by a factor of $1.6$. Using similar technique we estimate the total dark matter mass enclosed within $1$ Mpc from the Local Group barycenter to be $M_\rm LG(r<1\, \rm Mpc)=4.2_-2.0^+3.4\times10^12\,M_\odot$ ($90\$ confidence interval).

AB  - In this paper we will look at the phenomenon of Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (a maser system). We begin by deriving amplification by stimulated emission using time-dependent perturbation theory, in which the perturbation provided by external radiation. When this perturbation is applied to an ensemble of particles exhibiting a population inversion, the result is stimulated microwave radiation. We will explore both unsaturated and saturated masers and compare their properties. By understanding their gain, as well as the effect of line broadening, astronomers are to identify astrophysical masers. By studying such masers, we gain new insight into poorly understood physical environments, particularly those around young and old stars, and compact stellar bodies.

AB  - In order to understand nature of building blocks of galaxies in the early universe, we investigate "genuine irregular galaxies (GIGs)" in the nearby universe. Here, GIGs are defined as isolated galaxies without regular structures (spheroid, bulge, disk, bar, spiral arm, and nucleus). Using the results of two excellent studies on galaxy morphology based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we obtain a sample of 66 irregular galaxies. We carry out new classification of them into GIGs and non-GIGs which have regular structure or show evidence for galaxy interaction, by using the SDSS Data Release 10 images. We then find that a half of these irregular galaxies (33/66) are GIGs and obtain an unambiguous sample of 33 GIGs for the first time. We discuss their observational properties by comparing them with those of elliptical, S0, spiral galaxies, and irregular galaxies without the GIGs. We find that our GIGs have smaller sizes, lower optical luminosities, bluer rest-frame optical colors, lower surface stellar mass densities, and lower gas metallicity than normal galaxies. All these properties suggest that they are in chemically and dynamically younger phases even in the nearby universe.

AB  - Galaxy formation is at the forefront of observation and theory in cosmology. An improved understanding is essential for improving our knowledge both of the cosmological parameters, of the contents of the universe, and of our origins. In these lectures intended for graduate students, galaxy formation theory is reviewed and confronted with recent observational issues. In Lecture 1, the following topics are presented: star formation considerations, including IMF, star formation efficiency and star formation rate, the origin of the galaxy luminosity function, and feedback in dwarf galaxies. In Lecture 2, we describe formation of disks and massive spheroids, including the growth of supermassive black holes, negative feedback in spheroids, the AGN-star formation connection, star formation rates at high redshift and the baryon fraction in galaxies.

AB  - An analysis of more than 3000 galaxies resolved at better than 114pc/h at z=0.62 in a LAOZI cosmological adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulation is performed and insights gained on quenching and color migration. The vast majority of red galaxies are found to be within three virial radii of a larger galaxy, at the onset of quenching. We shall thus call this mechanism ``environment quenching", which encompasses satellite quenching. Two physical processes are largely responsible: ram-pressure stripping first disconnects the galaxy from the cold gas supply on large scales, followed by a longer period of cold gas starvation taking place in high velocity dispersion environment, during the early part of which the existing dense cold gas in the central region (=<10kpc) is consumed by in situ star formation. Quenching is found to be more efficient but not faster, on average, in denser environment. Throughout quenching galaxies follow nearly vertical tracks in the color-stellar-mass diagram. In contrast, individual galaxies of all masses grow most of their stellar masses in the blue cloud, prior to the onset of quenching, and progressively more massive blue galaxies with already relatively older mean stellar ages continue to enter the red sequence. Consequently, correlations among observables of red galaxies - such as the age-mass relation - are largely inherited from their blue progenitors at the onset of quenching. While the color makeup of the entire galaxy population strongly depends on environment, which is a direct result of environment quenching, physical properties of blue galaxies as a sub-population show little dependence on environment. A variety of predictions from the simulation are shown to be in accord with extant observations.

AB  - The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury is an ongoing Hubble Space Telescope Multi-Cycle Treasury program to image ~1/3 of M31's star-forming disk in six filters, spanning from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared (NIR). We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) to resolve the galaxy into millions of individual stars with projected radii from 0 to 20 kpc. The full survey will cover a contiguous 0.5 deg2area in 828 orbits. Imaging is being obtained in the F275W and F336W filters on the WFC3/UVIS camera, F475W and F814W on ACS/WFC, and F110W and F160W on WFC3/IR. The resulting wavelength coverage gives excellent constraints on stellar temperature, bolometric luminosity, and extinction for most spectral types. The data produce photometry with a signal-to-noise ratio of 4 at m F275W = 25.1, m F336W = 24.9, m F475W = 27.9, m F814W = 27.1, m F110W = 25.5, and m F160W = 24.6 for single pointings in the uncrowded outer disk; in the inner disk, however, the optical and NIR data are crowding limited, and the deepest reliable magnitudes are up to 5 mag brighter. Observations are carried out in two orbits per pointing, split between WFC3/UVIS and WFC3/IR cameras in primary mode, with ACS/WFC run in parallel. All pointings are dithered to produce Nyquist-sampled images in F475W, F814W, and F160W. We describe the observing strategy, photometry, astrometry, and data products available for the survey, along with extensive testing of photometric stability, crowding errors, spatially dependent photometric biases, and telescope pointing control. We also report on initial fits to the structure of M31's disk, derived from the density of red giant branch stars, in a way that is independent of assumed mass-to-light ratios and is robust to variations in dust extinction. These fits also show that the 10 kpc ring is not just a region of enhanced recent star formation, but is instead a dynamical structure containing a significant overdensity of stars with ages >1 Gyr.

AB  - The ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury (ANGST) is a systematic survey to establish a legacy of uniform multi-color photometry of resolved stars for a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies (D < 4 Mpc). The survey volume encompasses 69 galaxies in diverse environments, including close pairs, small and large groups, filaments, and truly isolated regions. The galaxies include a nearly complete range of morphological types spanning a factor of ~104 in luminosity and star formation rate. The survey data consist of images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), supplemented with archival data and new Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) imaging taken after the failure of ACS. Survey images include wide field tilings covering the full radial extent of each galaxy, and single deep pointings in uncrowded regions of the most massive galaxies in the volume. The new wide field imaging in ANGST reaches median 50% completenesses of m F475W = 28.0 mag, m F606W = 27.3 mag, and m F814W = 27.3 mag, several magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB). The deep fields reach magnitudes sufficient to fully resolve the structure in the red clump. The resulting photometric catalogs are publicly accessible and contain over 34 million photometric measurements of >14 million stars. In this paper we present the details of the sample selection, imaging, data reduction, and the resulting photometric catalogs, along with an analysis of the photometric uncertainties (systematic and random), for both ACS and WFPC2 imaging. We also present uniformly derived relative distances measured from the apparent magnitude of the TRGB.

AB  - The mass aggregation and merger histories of present-day distinct haloes selected from the cosmological Millennium Simulations I and II are mapped into stellar mass aggregation and galaxy merger histories of central galaxies by using empirical stellar-to-halo and stellar-to-gas mass relations. The growth of bulges driven by the galaxy mergers/interactions is calculated using analytical recipes. The predicted bulge demographics at redshift z~0 is consistent with observations (Zavala+2012). Here we present the evolution of the morphological mix (traced by the bulge-to-total mass ratio, B/T) as a function of mass up to z=3. This mix remains qualitatively the same up to z~1: B/T<0.1 galaxies dominate at low masses, 0.1<B/T<0.45 at intermediate masses, and B/T>0.45 at large masses. At z>1, the fractions of disc-dominated and bulgeless galaxies increase strongly, and by z~2 the era of pure disc galaxies is reached. Bulge-dominated galaxies acquire such a morphology, and most of their mass, following a downsizing trend. Since our results are consistent with several recent observational studies of the morphological mix at different redshifts, a LCDM-based scenario of merger-driven bulge assembly does not seem to face significant issues. However, if the stellar-to-halo mass relation changes too little with redshift, then some tensions with observations appear.

AB  - We present the AEGIS-X survey, a series of deep Chandra ACIS-I observations of the Extended Groth Strip. The survey comprises pointings at eight separate positions, each with nominal exposure of 200 ks, covering a total area of approximately 0.67 deg2 in a strip of length 2 degrees. We describe in detail an updated version of our data reduction and point-source-detection algorithms used to analyze these data. A total of 1325 band-merged sources have been found to a Poisson probability limit of 4 × 10-6, with limiting fluxes of 5.3 × 10-17 erg cm2 s-1 in the soft (0.5-2 keV) band and 3.8 × 10-16 erg cm-2 s-1 in the hard (2-10 keV) band. We present simulations verifying the validity of our source-detection procedure and showing a very small, <1.5%, contamination rate from spurious sources. Optical/NIR counterparts have been identified from the DEEP2, CFHTLS, and Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) surveys of the same region. Using a likelihood ratio method, we find optical counterparts for 76% of our sources, complete to R AB = 24.1, and, of the 66% of the sources that have IRAC coverage, 94% have a counterpart to a limit of 0.9 muJy at 3.6 mum (m AB = 23.8). After accounting for (small) positional offsets in the eight Chandra fields, the astrometric accuracy of Chandra positions is found to be 0farcs8 rms; however, this number depends both on the off-axis angle and the number of detected counts for a given source. All data products described in this paper are made available via a public Web site.

AB  - We present point-source catalogs for the ~2 Ms exposure of the Chandra Deep Field North, currently the deepest X-ray observation of the universe in the 0.5-8.0 keV band. Five hundred and three (503) X-ray sources are detected over an ~448 arcmin2 area in up to seven X-ray bands. Twenty (20) of these X-ray sources lie in the central ~5.3 arcmin2 Hubble Deep Field North (13,600+3800-3000 sources deg-2). The on-axis sensitivity limits are ~2.5 × 10-17 ergs cm-2 s-1 (0.5-2.0 keV) and ~1.4 × 10-16 ergs cm-2 s-1 (2-8 keV). Source positions are determined using matched-filter and centroiding techniques; the median positional uncertainty is ~0.3". The X-ray colors of the detected sources indicate a broad variety of source types, although absorbed AGNs (including a small number of possible Compton-thick sources) are clearly the dominant type. We also match lower significance X-ray sources to optical counterparts and provide a list of 79 optically bright (R<~23) lower significance Chandra sources. The majority of these sources appear to be starburst and normal galaxies. The average backgrounds in the 0.5-2.0 keV and 2-8 keV bands are 0.056 and 0.135 counts Ms-1 pixel-1, respectively. The background count distributions are very similar to Poisson distributions. We show that this ~2 Ms exposure is approximately photon limited in all seven X-ray bands for regions close to the aim point, and we predict that exposures up to ~25 Ms (0.5-2.0 keV) and ~4 Ms (2-8 keV) should remain nearly photon limited. We demonstrate that this observation does not suffer from source confusion within ~6' of the aim point, and future observations are unlikely to be source-confusion limited within ~3' of the aim point even for source densities exceeding 100,000 deg-2. These analyses directly show that Chandra can achieve significantly higher sensitivities in an efficient, nearly photon-limited manner and be largely free of source confusion. To allow consistent comparisons, we have also produced point-source catalogs for the ~1 Ms Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S). Three hundred and twenty-six (326) X-ray sources are included in the main Chandra catalog, and an additional 42 optically bright X-ray sources are included in a lower significance Chandra catalog. We find good agreement with the photometry of the previously published CDF-S catalogs; however, we provide significantly improved positional accuracy.

AB  - We report the final optical identifications of the medium-depth (~60 ks), contiguous (2 deg2) XMM-Newton survey of the COSMOS field. XMM-Newton has detected ~1800 X-ray sources down to limiting fluxes of ~5 × 10-16, ~3 × 10-15, and ~7 × 10-15 erg cm-2 s-1 in the 0.5-2 keV, 2-10 keV, and 5-10 keV bands, respectively (~1 × 10-15, ~6 × 10-15, and ~1 × 10-14 erg cm-2 s-1, in the three bands, respectively, over 50% of the area). The work is complemented by an extensive collection of multiwavelength data from 24 mum to UV, available from the COSMOS survey, for each of the X-ray sources, including spectroscopic redshifts for gsim50% of the sample, and high-quality photometric redshifts for the rest. The XMM and multiwavelength flux limits are well matched: 1760 (98%) of the X-ray sources have optical counterparts, 1711 (~95%) have IRAC counterparts, and 1394 (~78%) have MIPS 24 mum detections. Thanks to the redshift completeness (almost 100%) we were able to constrain the high-luminosity tail of the X-ray luminosity function confirming that the peak of the number density of log LX > 44.5 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is at z ~ 2. Spectroscopically identified obscured and unobscured AGNs, as well as normal and star-forming galaxies, present well-defined optical and infrared properties. We devised a robust method to identify a sample of ~150 high-redshift (z > 1), obscured AGN candidates for which optical spectroscopy is not available. We were able to determine that the fraction of the obscured AGN population at the highest (LX > 1044 erg s-1) X-ray luminosity is ~15%-30% when selection effects are taken into account, providing an important observational constraint for X-ray background synthesis. We studied in detail the optical spectrum and the overall spectral energy distribution of a prototypical Type 2 QSO, caught in a stage transitioning from being starburst dominated to AGN dominated, which was possible to isolate only thanks to the combination of X-ray and infrared observations.

AB  - We present the mid-infrared colors of X-ray-detected AGNs and explore mid-infrared selection criteria. Using a statistical matching technique, the likelihood ratio, over 900 IRAC counterparts were identified with a new MUSYC X-ray source catalog that includes ~1000 published X-ray sources in the Chandra Deep Field-South and Extended Chandra Deep Field-South. Most X-ray-selected AGNs have IRAC spectral shapes consistent with power-law slopes, fnu~nualpha, and display a wide range of colors, -2<=alpha<=2. Although X-ray sources typically fit to redder (more negative alpha) power laws than non-X-ray-detected galaxies, more than 50% do have flat or blue (galaxy-like) spectral shapes in the observed 3-8 mum band. Only a quarter of the X-ray-selected AGNs detected at 24 mum are well fit by featureless red power laws in the observed 3.6-24 mum, likely the subset of our sample whose infrared spectra are dominated by emission from the central AGN region. Most IRAC color selection criteria fail to identify the majority of X-ray-selected AGNs, finding only the more luminous AGNs, the majority of which have broad emission lines. In deep surveys, these color selection criteria select 10%-20% of the entire galaxy population and miss many moderate-luminosity AGNs.

AB  - The Chandra COSMOS Survey (C-COSMOS) is a large, 1.8 Ms, Chandra program that has imaged the central 0.5 deg2 of the COSMOS field (centered at 10 h , +02 o ) with an effective exposure of ~160 ks, and an outer 0.4 deg2 area with an effective exposure of ~80 ks. The limiting source detection depths are 1.9 × 10-16 erg cm-2 s-1 in the soft (0.5-2 keV) band, 7.3 × 10-16 erg cm-2 s-1 in the hard (2-10 keV) band, and 5.7 × 10-16 erg cm-2 s-1 in the full (0.5-10 keV) band. Here we describe the strategy, design, and execution of the C-COSMOS survey, and present the catalog of 1761 point sources detected at a probability of being spurious of <2 × 10-5 (1655 in the full, 1340 in the soft, and 1017 in the hard bands). By using a grid of 36 heavily (~50%) overlapping pointing positions with the ACIS-I imager, a remarkably uniform ($\pm$12%) exposure across the inner 0.5 deg2 field was obtained, leading to a sharply defined lower flux limit. The widely different point-spread functions obtained in each exposure at each point in the field required a novel source detection method, because of the overlapping tiling strategy, which is described in a companion paper. This method produced reliable sources down to a 7-12 counts, as verified by the resulting logN-logS curve, with subarcsecond positions, enabling optical and infrared identifications of virtually all sources, as reported in a second companion paper. The full catalog is described here in detail and is available online.

AB  - We estimated black hole masses and Eddington ratios for a sample of X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the fields covered by the Great Observatory Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). The spanned ranges in redshift (0.4<z<1) and hard X-ray luminosity (1042<~LX<~4×1043 ergs s-1) allow us to study a representative subsample of the main contributors to the 2-10 keV X-ray background. Nuclear and bulge magnitudes in four bands have been measured via a two-dimensional decomposition applied to HST ACS images. Using the black hole versus bulge luminosity relation and the intrinsic nuclear emission, we derived the black hole mass and the AGN bolometric luminosity. We find in our sample that (1) the X-ray-to-optical indices are larger than in optically selected QSOs, as expected due to the X-ray selection); (2) the X-ray bolometric corrections are generally small, suggesting a decrease with the nuclear luminosity; (3) the Eddington ratios are about a factor 10 below the values found at higher redshift and luminosity; (4) the central black holes have rather large masses; and (5) at least for z<~0.8, a scarceness of black holes with mass MBH<=106 Msolar and accretion rate near the Eddington limit: this result could be ascribed to a decline in their number density, or it could suggest a substantial accretion at higher redshift (z>~1) also for these smaller black holes.

AB  - We study the properties of giant clumps and their radial gradients in high-z disc galaxies using AMR cosmological simulations. Our sample consists of 770 snapshots in the redshift range z=4-1 from 29 galaxies that at z=2 span the stellar mass range $(0.2-3)\times 10^11 M_\odot$. Extended gas discs exist in 83% of the snapshots. Clumps are identified by gas density in 3D and their stellar and dark matter components are considered thereafter. While most of the overdensities are diffuse and elongated, 91% of their mass and 83% of their star-fromation rate (SFR) are in compact round clumps. Nearly all galaxies have a central, massive bulge clump, while 70% of the discs show off-center clumps, 3-4 per galaxy. The fraction of clumpy discs peaks at intermediate disc masses. Clumps are divided based on dark-matter content into in-situ and ex-situ, originating from violent disc instability (VDI) and minor mergers respectively. 60% of the discs are in a VDI phase showing off-center in-situ clumps, which contribute 1-7% of the disc mass and 5-45% of its SFR. The in-situ clumps constitute 75% of the off-center clumps in terms of number and SFR but only half the mass, each clump containing on average 1% of the disc mass and 6% of its SFR. The in-situ clumps have young stellar ages, 100-400 Myr, and high specific SFR (sSFR), 1-10 $Gyr^-1$. They exhibit certain gradients resulting from inward clump migration, where the inner clumps are somewhat more massive and older, with lower gas fraction and sSFR and higher metallicity. Similar observed gradients indicate that the clumps survive outflows. The ex-situ clumps have stellar ages 0.5-3 Gyr and sSFR 0.1-2 $Gyr^-1$, and they exhibit weaker gradients. Massive clumps of old stars at large radii are most likely ex-situ mergers, though half of them share the disc rotation.

AB  - We have performed Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a sample of 23 high-redshift (1.8<z<2.75) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), drawn from the COMBO-17 survey. The sample contains moderately luminous quasars (MB~-23). The data are part of the Galaxy Evolution from Morphologies and SEDs imaging survey that provides high-resolution optical images obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys in two bands (F606W and F850LP), sampling the rest-frame UV flux of the targets. To deblend the AGN images into nuclear and resolved (host galaxy) components, we use a point-spread function subtraction technique that is strictly conservative with respect to the flux of the host galaxy. We resolve the host galaxies in both filter bands in nine of the 23 AGNs, whereas the remaining 14 objects are considered nondetections, with upper limits of less than 5% of the nuclear flux. However, when we co-add the unresolved AGN images into a single high signal-to-noise ratio composite image, we find again an unambiguously resolved host galaxy. The recovered host galaxies have apparent magnitudes of 23.0<F606W<26.0 and 22.5<F850LP<24.5, with rest-frame UV colors in the range -0.2<(F606W-F850LP)obs<2.3. The rest-frame absolute magnitudes at 200 nm are -20.0<M200nm<-22.2. The photometric properties of the composite host are consistent with the individual resolved host galaxies. We find that the UV colors of all host galaxies are substantially bluer than expected from an old population of stars with formation redshift z<=5, independent of the assumed metallicities. These UV colors and luminosities range up to the values found for Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z=3. Our results suggest either a recent starburst of, e.g., a few percent of the total stellar mass at 100 Myr before observation, with mass fraction and age strongly degenerate, or the possibility that the detected UV emission may be due to young stars forming continuously. For the latter case we estimate star formation rates of typically ~6 Msolar yr-1 (uncorrected for internal dust attenuation), which again lies in the range of rates implied from the UV flux of LBGs. Our results agree with the recent discovery of enhanced blue stellar light in AGN hosts at lower redshifts.

AB  - We use Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys images and a photometric catalog of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field to analyze morphologies of the host galaxies of ~400 active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates at redshifts 0.3 < z < 1.0. We compare the AGN hosts with a sample of nonactive galaxies drawn from the COSMOS field to match the magnitude and redshift distribution of the AGN hosts. We perform two-dimensional surface brightness modeling with GALFIT to yield host galaxy and nuclear point source magnitudes. X-ray-selected AGN host galaxy morphologies span a substantial range that peaks between those of early-type, bulge-dominated and late-type, disk-dominated systems. We also measure the asymmetry and concentration of the host galaxies. Unaccounted for, the nuclear point source can significantly bias results of these measured structural parameters, so we subtract the best-fit point source component to obtain images of the underlying host galaxies. Our concentration measurements reinforce the findings of our two-dimensional morphology fits, placing X-ray AGN hosts between early- and late-type inactive galaxies. AGN host asymmetry distributions are consistent with those of control galaxies. Combined with a lack of excess companion galaxies around AGN, the asymmetry distributions indicate that strong interactions are no more prevalent among AGN than normal galaxies. In light of recent work, these results suggest that the host galaxies of AGN at these X-ray luminosities may be in a transition from disk-dominated to bulge-dominated, but that this transition is not typically triggered by major mergers.

AB  - We have analyzed the redshift-dependent fraction of galactic bars over 0.2<z<0.84 in 2157 luminous face-on spiral galaxies from the COSMOS 2 deg2 field. Our sample is an order of magnitude larger than that used in any previous investigation, and is based on substantially deeper imaging data than that available from earlier wide-area studies of high-redshift galaxy morphology. We find that the fraction of barred spirals declines rapidly with redshift. Whereas in the local universe about 65% of luminous spiral galaxies contain bars (SB+SAB), at z~0.84 this fraction drops to about 20%. Over this redshift range the fraction of strong bars (SBs) drops from about 30% to under 10%. It is clear that when the universe was half its present age, the census of galaxies on the Hubble sequence was fundamentally different from that of the present day. A major clue to understanding this phenomenon has also emerged from our analysis, which shows that the bar fraction in spiral galaxies is a strong function of stellar mass, integrated color and bulge prominence. The bar fraction in very massive, luminous spirals is about constant out to z~0.84, whereas for the low-mass, blue spirals it declines significantly with redshift beyond z=0.3. There is also a slight preference for bars in bulge-dominated systems at high redshifts that may be an important clue toward the coevolution of bars, bulges, and black holes. Our results thus have important ramifications for the processes responsible for galactic downsizing, suggesting that massive galaxies matured early in a dynamical sense, and not just as a result of the regulation of their star formation rate.

AB  - The paper contains preliminary results from a photographic study of 30 nearby Seyfert galaxies (VR less than 5000 km/s). The appearance of these well-resolved objects suggests that the morphology of both Seyfert type 1 and type 2 galaxies is characterized by a three-step distribution in the radial surface brightness of the disk. Superposed on this three-step distribution is a continuum of spiral-like patterns, ranging from sharp, distinct arms to diffuse, amorphous segments. An interpretation of this morphology is presented which suggests that the nuclear activity in these objects is fed by gas from the disk and that the disturbed amorphous structure found in some Seyferts is the end product of this feeding. Analysis of the relation between the inclination of the disk and the H-beta FWZI for type 1 Seyferts in this sample suggests that these may be correlated. However, an alternative interpretation of this relation is that larger values of FWZI are associated with more amorphous type 1 Seyferts. The space density in the sample of Seyfert galaxies discussed here appears to be greater than that previously ascribed to these objects.

AB  - Galactic bars are the most important driver of secular evolution in galaxies. They can efficiently drive gas into the central kiloparsec of galaxies, thus feed circumnuclear starbursts, and possibly help to fuel AGN. The connection between bars and AGN activities has been actively debated in the past two decades. Previous work used fairly small samples and often lacked a proper control sample. They reported conflicting results on the correlation between bars and AGN activity. Here we revisit the bar-AGN and bar-starburst connections using the analysis of bars in a large sample of about 2000 SDSS disk galaxies (Barazza, Jogee, & Marinova 2008). We find that AGN and star-forming galaxies have similar optical bar fractions, 47% and 50%, respectively. Both bar fractions are higher than that in inactive galaxies (29%). We discuss the implications of the study on the relationship between host galaxies and their central activities.

AB  - We present a detailed study of the relation between circumnuclear dust morphology, host-galaxy properties, and nuclear activity in nearby galaxies. We use our sample of 123 nearby galaxies with visible-near-infrared color maps from the Hubble Space Telescope to create well-matched, ``paired'' samples of 28 active and 28 inactive galaxies, as well as 19 barred and 19 unbarred galaxies, that have the same host-galaxy properties. Comparison of the barred and unbarred galaxies shows that grand-design nuclear dust spirals are found only in galaxies with a large-scale bar. These nuclear dust spirals, which are present in approximately one-third of all barred galaxies, also appear to be connected to the dust lanes along the leading edges of the large-scale bars. Grand-design nuclear spirals are more common than inner rings, which are present in only a small minority of the barred galaxies. Tightly wound nuclear dust spirals, in contrast, show a strong tendency to avoid galaxies with large-scale bars. Comparison of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs)and inactive samples shows that nuclear dust spirals, which may trace shocks and angular momentum dissipation in the interstellar medium, occur with comparable frequency in both active and inactive galaxies. The only difference between the active and inactive galaxies is that several inactive galaxies appear to completely lack dust structure in their circumnuclear region, while none of the AGNs lack this structure. The comparable frequency of nuclear spirals in active and inactive galaxies, combined with previous work that finds no significant difference in the frequency of bars or interactions between well-matched active and inactive galaxies, suggests that no universal fueling mechanism for low-luminosity AGNs operates at spatial scales greater than a ~100 pc radius from the galactic nuclei. The similarities of the circumnuclear environments of active and inactive galaxies suggest that the lifetime of nuclear activity is less than the characteristic inflow time from these spatial scales. An order-of-magnitude estimate of this inflow time is the dynamical timescale. This sets an upper limit of several million years to the lifetime of an individual episode of nuclear activity.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.

AB  - Gravitational perturbation strengths and bar fractions in active and nonactive galaxies are compared using the Ohio State University Bright Galaxy Survey, which forms a statistically well defined sample of 180 disk galaxies. Bar fractions are studied using (1) the optical and near-IR classification of bars made by Eskridge and coworkers in 2002 and (2) our own bar classification based on Fourier decomposition of near-IR images (Fourier bars). The gravitational perturbation strengths are calculated using the bar torque method, taking the maximum ratio Qg of the tangential force to the mean background radial force as a measure of the nonaxisymmetric perturbation. In addition, two-dimensional bulge-disk-bar decomposition is used to study the properties of bulges of the sample galaxies. In the near-IR, Seyfert galaxies, LINERs, and H II/starburst galaxies were found to have a similar fraction, 72%, of Fourier bars (or SB-type bars), compared to 55% in the nonactive galaxies. However, if SAB-type bars are also included, practically all (95%) H II/starburst galaxies have bars. In addition, a large fraction (34%) of bars in LINERs are obscured by dust in the optical region. We find that bars in early-type galaxies are at the same time long and massive and have weak perturbation strengths. Weak perturbation strengths can be explained by dilution of the nonaxisymmetric forces by the massive bulges: for a bulge-to-disk mass ratio B/D ranging from 0 to 1, the dilution may reduce Qg from as high as 0.6 to as low as 0.1. On the other hand, bar length (relative to disk scale length) is not correlated with B/D, contrary to expectation. Seyfert- or LINER-type nuclear activity is present in most galaxies that have thin and thick planar bar components, whereas nuclear activity does not appear in those late-type galaxies that have extremely massive bars and strong perturbation strengths.

AB  - Barlike structures were investigated in a sample of 186 disk galaxies larger than 0.5" that are in the I-band image of the Tadpole galaxy taken with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys. We found 22 clear cases of barred galaxies, 21 galaxies with small bars that appear primarily as isophotal twists in a contour plot, and 11 cases of peculiar bars in clump-cluster galaxies, which are face-on versions of chain galaxies. The latter bars are probably young, as the galaxies contain only weak interclump emission. Four of the clearly barred galaxies at z~0.8-1.2 have grand-design spirals. The bar fraction was determined as a function of galaxy inclination and compared with the analogous distribution in the local universe. The bar fraction was also determined as a function of galaxy angular size. These distributions suggest that inclination and resolution effects obscure nearly half of the bars in our sample. The bar fraction was also determined as a function of redshift. We found a nearly constant bar fraction of 0.23+/-0.03 from z~0 to z=1.1. When corrected for inclination and size effects, this fraction is comparable to the bar fraction in the local universe, ~0.4, which we tabulated for all bar and Hubble types in the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies. The average major axis of a barred galaxy in our sample is ~10 kpc after correcting for redshift with a Lambda-dominated cold dark matter cosmology. The average exponential scale length is ~2 kpc. These are half the sizes of local barred galaxies and not likely to be influenced much by cosmological dimming, because the high-z galaxies are intrinsically brighter. We conclude that galaxy bars were present in normal abundance at least ~8 Gyr ago (z~1) the bars in clump-cluster galaxies may have formed from gaseous disk instabilities and star formation rather than stellar disk instabilities, and bar dissolution cannot be common during a Hubble time unless the bar formation rate is comparable to the dissolution rate. If galaxy interactions trigger bar formation more than bar destruction, then the higher interaction rate in the past suggests relatively few bars actually dissolved in a Hubble time.

AB  - We use a recent near-infrared imaging survey of samples of Seyfert and normal galaxies to study the role of bars in the fueling of nuclear activity. The active galaxy sample includes Seyfert galaxies in the Revised Shapely-Ames (RSA) catalog and Sandage & Tammann's extension of this catalog. The normal galaxies were selected to match the Seyfert sample in Hubble type, redshift, inclination, and blue luminosity. All the galaxies in both samples classified as barred in the RSA catalog are also barred in the near-infrared. In addition, ~55% of the galaxies classified as nonbarred in the RSA show evidence for bars at 2.1 mu m. Overall, ~70% of the galaxies observed show evidence for bar structures. The incidence of bars in the Seyfert and normal galaxies is similar, suggesting that Seyfert nuclei do not occur preferentially in barred systems. Furthermore, a slightly higher percentage of normal galaxies have multiple-bar structures. A significant percentage of the Seyfert galaxies in our sample show no evidence for the presence of a bar even in the near-infrared. This suggests either that large-scale kiloparsec bars are not a universal fueling mechanism in Seyfert galaxies or that the bars in the nonbarred Seyferts were recently destroyed, possibly by the formation of the central black hole.

AB  - The Zooniverse is a collection of online citizen science projects with over 600,000 volunteers worldwide.  With more than thirty peer-reviewed academic publications across ten projects, the Zooniverse is firmly established as a tool for researchers.  Zooniverse volunteers participate in a variety of scientific tasks ranging from galaxy classification (Galaxy Zoo) to the transcription of ancient Greek papyri (Ancient Lives), demonstrating that citizen science is applicable to a diverse range of research fields. While they were not primarily conceived as such, the accessible nature of the Zooniverse projects makes them a valuable tool for scientific outreach.  After all, what better way to communicate science than to ask people to contribute to research?  In this session Zooniverse developers and educators demonstrated educational resources complementing Zooniverse projects for informal learning audiences, formal learning audiences and Zooniverse volunteers.

AB  - Searches for transient astrophysical sources often reveal unexpected classes of objects that are useful physical laboratories. In a recent survey for pulsars and fast transients, we have uncovered four millisecond-duration radio transients all more than 40$\,^\circ$ from the Galactic plane. The bursts' properties indicate that they are of celestial rather than terrestrial origin. Host galaxy and intergalactic medium models suggest that they have cosmological redshifts of 0.5 to 1 and distances of up to 3 gigaparsecs. No temporally coincident x- or gamma-ray signature was identified in association with the bursts. Characterization of the source population and identification of host galaxies offers an opportunity to determine the baryonic content of the universe.

AB  - What is the relevance of major mergers and interactions as triggering mechanisms for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) activity? To answer this long-standing question, we analyze 140 XMM-Newton-selected AGN host galaxies and a matched control sample of 1264 inactive galaxies over z ~ 0.3-1.0 and M * < 1011.7 M sun with high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging from the COSMOS field. The visual analysis of their morphologies by 10 independent human classifiers yields a measure of the fraction of distorted morphologies in the AGN and control samples, i.e., quantifying the signature of recent mergers which might potentially be responsible for fueling/triggering the AGN. We find that (1) the vast majority (>85%) of the AGN host galaxies do not show strong distortions and (2) there is no significant difference in the distortion fractions between active and inactive galaxies. Our findings provide the best direct evidence that, since z ~ 1, the bulk of black hole (BH) accretion has not been triggered by major galaxy mergers, therefore arguing that the alternative mechanisms, i.e., internal secular processes and minor interactions, are the leading triggers for the episodes of major BH growth. We also exclude an alternative interpretation of our results: a substantial time lag between merging and the observability of the AGN phase could wash out the most significant merging signatures, explaining the lack of enhancement of strong distortions on the AGN hosts. We show that this alternative scenario is unlikely due to (1) recent major mergers being ruled out for the majority of sources due to the high fraction of disk-hosted AGNs, (2) the lack of a significant X-ray signal in merging inactive galaxies as a signature of a potential buried AGN, and (3) the low levels of soft X-ray obscuration for AGNs hosted by interacting galaxies, in contrast to model predictions.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555; the XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and NASA; European Southern Observatory under Large Program 175.A-0839; and the Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.

AB  - We investigate morphological structure parameters and local environments of distant moderate-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies in the overlap between the HST/ACS observations of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) and the two Chandra Deep Fields. We compute near-neighbor counts and BViz asymmetry (A) and concentration (C) indices for ~35,500 GOODS/ACS galaxies complete to z850~26.6, including the resolved hosts of 322 X-ray-selected AGNs. Distributions of (1) z850 asymmetry for 130 z850<23 AGN hosts and (2) near-neighbor counts for 173 z850<24 AGN hosts are both consistent with non-AGN control samples. This implies no close connection between recent galaxy mergers and moderate-luminosity AGN activity out to appreciable look-back times (z<~1.3), approaching the epoch of peak AGN activity in the universe. The distribution of z850 C for the AGN hosts is offset by DeltaC~+0.5 compared to the non-AGN, a 6.4 sigma discrepancy much larger than can be explained by the possible influence of unresolved emission from the AGN or a circumnuclear starburst. The local universe association between AGN and bulge-dominated galaxies thus persists to substantial look-back time. We discuss implications in the context of the low-redshift supermassive central black hole mass correlation with host galaxy properties, including concentration.

AB  - We visually and quantitatively determine the host galaxy morphologies of 94 intermediate-redshift (0.2<=z<1.2) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), selected using Chandra X-ray data and Spitzer mid-infrared data in the Extended Groth Strip. Using recently developed morphology measures, the second-order moment of the brightest 20% of a galaxy's flux (M20) and the Gini coefficient, we find that X-ray-selected AGNs mostly reside in E/S0/Sa galaxies (53+11-10%), while IR-selected AGNs show no clear preference for host morphology. X-ray-selected AGN hosts are members of close pairs more often than the field population by a factor of 3.3+/-1.4, but most of these pair members appear to be undisturbed early-type galaxies and do not tend to show direct evidence of gravitational perturbations or interactions. Thus, the activation mechanism for AGN activity remains unknown, even for pair members.

AB  - We describe the effect of active galactic nucleus (AGN) light on host galaxy optical and UV-optical colours, as determined from X-ray-selected AGN host galaxies at z ~ 1, and compare the AGN host galaxy colours to those of a control sample matched to the AGN sample in both redshift and stellar mass. We identify as X-ray-selected AGNs 8.7+4-3 per cent of the red-sequence control galaxies, 9.8 +/- 3 per cent of the blue-cloud control galaxies and 14.7+4-3 per cent of the green-valley control galaxies. The nuclear colours of AGN hosts are generally bluer than their outer colours, while the control galaxies exhibit redder nuclei. AGNs in blue-cloud host galaxies experience less X-ray obscuration, while AGNs in red-sequence hosts have more, which is the reverse of what is expected from general considerations of the interstellar medium. Outer and integrated colours of AGN hosts generally agree with the control galaxies, regardless of X-ray obscuration, but the nuclear colours of unobscured AGNs are typically much bluer, especially for X-ray luminous objects. Visible point sources are seen in many of these, indicating that the nuclear colours have been contaminated by AGN light and that obscuration of the X-ray radiation and visible light are therefore highly correlated. Red AGN hosts are typically slightly bluer than red-sequence control galaxies, which suggests that their stellar populations are slightly younger. We compare these colour data to current models of AGN formation. The unexpected trend of less X-ray obscuration in blue-cloud galaxies and more in red-sequence galaxies is problematic for all AGN feedback models, in which gas and dust is thought to be removed as star formation shuts down. A second class of models involving radiative instabilities in hot gas is more promising for red-sequence AGNs but predicts a larger number of point sources in red-sequence AGNs than is observed. Regardless, it appears that multiple AGN models are necessary to explain the varied AGN host properties discussed in the current work. Finally, we find that integrated optical and UV - optical colours are not strongly affected by X-ray-selected AGNs except in rare cases (<10 per cent), where the AGN is very luminous, unobscured and/or visible as a point source.

AB  - We assess the effects of simulated active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the colour and morphology measurements of their host galaxies. To test the morphology measurements, we select a sample of galaxies not known to host AGN and add a series of point sources scaled to represent specified fractions of the observed V-band light detected from the resulting systems; we then compare morphology measurements of the simulated systems to measurements of the original galaxies. AGN contributions >rsim 20 per cent bias most of the morphology measurements tested, though the extent of the apparent bias depends on the morphological characteristics of the original galaxies. We test colour measurements by adding to non-AGN galaxy spectra a quasar spectrum scaled to contribute specified fractions of the rest-frame B-band light detected from the resulting systems. A quasar fraction of 5 per cent can move the NUV - r colour of an elliptical galaxy from the ultraviolet-optical red sequence to the green valley, and 20 per cent can move it into the blue cloud. Combining the colour and morphology results, we find that a galaxy/AGN system with an AGN contribution >rsim 20 per cent may appear bluer and more bulge dominated than the underlying galaxy. We conclude that (1) bulge-dominated, E/S0/Sa, and early-type morphology classifications are accurate for red AGN host galaxies and may be accurate for blue host galaxies, unless the AGN manifests itself as a well-defined point source and (2) although highly unobscured AGN, such as the quasar used for our experiments, can significantly bias the measured colours of AGN host galaxies, it is possible to identify such systems by examining optical images of the hosts for the presence of a point source and/or measuring the level of nuclear obscuration.

AB  - In the first of a series of papers investigating emission from blazar jets from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, we revisit the class of models where the jet has a uniform conical ballistic structure. We argue that by using simple developments of these models, in the context of new multifrequency data extending to gamma-ray energies, valuable insights may be obtained into the properties that fully realistic models must ultimately have. In this paper we consider the synchrotron and synchrotron-self-Compton emission from the jet, modelling the recent simultaneous multiwavelength observations of BL Lac. This is the first time these components have been fitted simultaneously for a blazar using a conical jet model.  In the model we evolve the electron population dynamically along the jet taking into account the synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses. The inverse-Compton emission is calculated using the Klein-Nishina cross-section and a relativistic transformation into the jet frame, and we explicitly show the seed photon population. We integrate synchrotron opacity along the line of sight through the jet plasma, taking into account the emission and opacity of each section of the jet. In agreement with previous studies of radio emission, we find that a conical jet model which conserves magnetic energy produces the characteristic blazar flat radio spectrum; however, we do not require any fine-tuning of the model to achieve this. Of particular note, in our model fit to BL Lac - which at ˜1037 W is a relatively low jet-power source - we find no requirement for significant re-acceleration within the jet to explain the observed spectrum.

AB  - Motivated by the desire to reliably and automatically classify structure of thousands of COSMOS galaxies, we present ZEST, the Zurich Estimator of Structural Types. To classify galaxy structure, ZEST uses (1) five nonparametric diagnostics: asymmetry, concentration, Gini coefficient, second-order moment of the brightest 20% of galaxy pixels, and ellipticity; and (2) the exponent n of single-Sérsic fits to the two-dimensional surface brightness distributions. To fully exploit the wealth of information while reducing the redundancy present in these diagnostics, ZEST performs a principal component (PC) analysis. We use a sample of ~56,000 IAB<=24 COSMOS galaxies to show that the first three PCs fully describe the key aspects of the galaxy structure, i.e., to calibrate a three-dimensional classification grid of axes PC1, PC2, and PC3. We demonstrate the robustness of the ZEST grid on the z=0 sample of Frei et al. The ZEST classification breaks most of the degeneracy between different galaxy populations that affects morphological classifications based on only some of the diagnostics included in ZEST. As a first application, we present the evolution since z~1 of the luminosity functions (LFs) of COSMOS galaxies of early, disk, and irregular galaxies and, for disk galaxies, of different bulge-to-disk ratios. Overall, we find that the LF up to a redshift z=1 is consistent with a pure luminosity evolution (of about 0.95 mag at z~0.7). We highlight, however, two trends that are in general agreement with a downsizing scenario for galaxy formation, i.e., (1) a deficit of a factor of about 2 at z~0.7 of MB>-20.5 structurally classified early-type galaxies and (2) an excess of a factor of about 3, at a similar redshift, of irregular galaxies.

AB  - We present the data release for Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2), a citizen science project with more than 16 million morphological classifications of 304 122 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Morphology is a powerful probe for quantifying a galaxy's dynamical history; however, automatic classifications of morphology (either by computer analysis of images or by using other physical parameters as proxies) still have drawbacks when compared to visual inspection. The large number of images available in current surveys makes visual inspection of each galaxy impractical for individual astronomers. GZ2 uses classifications from volunteer citizen scientists to measure morphologies for all galaxies in the DR7 Legacy survey with mr > 17, in addition to deeper images from SDSS Stripe 82. While the original GZ2 project identified galaxies as early-types, late-types or mergers, GZ2 measures finer morphological features. These include bars, bulges and the shapes of edge-on disks, as well as quantifying the relative strengths of galactic bulges and spiral arms. This paper presents the full public data release for the project, including measures of accuracy and bias. The majority (≳90 per cent) of GZ2 classifications agree with those made by professional astronomers, especially for morphological T-types, strong bars and arm curvature. Both the raw and reduced data products can be obtained in electronic format at http://data.galaxyzoo.org.

I connect these rules to the operations performed in probabilistic data analysis. Dimensional analysis is emphasized as a valuable tool for helping to construct non-wrong probabilistic statements. The applications of probability calculus in constructing likelihoods, marginalized likelihoods, posterior probabilities, and posterior predictions are all discussed.

AB  - We describe the creation of a set of artificially ``redshifted'' galaxies in the range 0.1<z<1.1 using a set of ~100 SDSS low-redshift (v<7000 km s-1) images as input. The intention is to generate a training set of realistic images of galaxies of diverse morphologies and a large range of redshifts for the GEMS and COSMOS galaxy evolution projects. This training set allows other studies to investigate and quantify the effects of cosmological redshift on the determination of galaxy morphologies, distortions, and other galaxy properties that are potentially sensitive to resolution, surface brightness, and bandpass issues. We use galaxy images from the SDSS in the u, g, r, i, and z filter bands as input, and computed new galaxy images from these data, resembling the same galaxies located at redshifts 0.1<z<1.1 and viewed with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST ACS). For this process we take into account angular size change, cosmological surface brightness dimming, and spectral change. The latter is achieved by interpolating a spectral energy distribution that is fit to the input images on a pixel-to-pixel basis. The output images are created for the specific HST ACS point-spread function and the filters used for GEMS (F606W and F850LP) and COSMOS (F814W). All images are binned onto the desired pixel grids (0.03" for GEMS and 0.05" for COSMOS) and corrected to an appropriate point-spread function. Noise is added corresponding to the data quality of the two projects, and the images are added onto empty sky pieces of real data images. We make these data sets available on our Web site, as well as the code-FERENGI (Full and Efficient Redshifting of Ensembles of Nearby Galaxy Images)-to enable data sets for other redshifts and/or instruments to be produced.

AB  - Context. Local Group (LG) timing is one of the first historical probes of the so-called missing mass problem. Whilst modern cosmological probes indicate that pure baryonic dynamics is not sufficient on the largest scales, nearby galaxies and small galaxy groups persistently obey Milgrom's MOND law, which implies that dynamics at small scales is possibly entirely predicted by the baryons.  Aims: Here, we investigate LG timing in this context of Milgromian dynamics.  Methods: We used the latest measured proper motions and radial velocities for Andromeda and the Magellanic clouds, and we integrated their orbits backwards by making use of the Milgromian two-body equation of motion.  Results: With the currently measured proper motions and radial velocity of M31, we find that MOND would imply that the Milky Way (MW) and M31 first moved apart via Hubble expansion after birth, but then necessarily were attracted again by the Milgromian gravitational attraction, and had a past fly-by encounter before coming to their present positions. This encounter would most probably have happened 7 to 11 Gyr ago (0.8 < z < 3). The absence of a dark matter halo and its associated dynamical friction is necessary for such a close encounter not to have triggered a merger. Observational arguments which could exclude or favour such a past encounter would thus be very important in order to falsify or vindicate Milgromian dynamics on the scale of the LG. Interestingly, the closest approach of the encounter is small enough (<55 kpc) to have had severe consequences on the disc dynamics, including perhaps thick disc formation, and on the satellite systems of both galaxies. The ages of the satellite galaxies and of the young halo globular clusters, all of which form the vast polar structure around the MW, are consistent with these objects having been born during this encounter.

AB  - We review Foyle et al. (2011) previous results, by applying a Fourier intensity phases method to a nine object sample of galaxies. It was found that two of the objects (NGC 628 and NGC 5194), with strong two-arm patterns, present positive evidence for long-lived spirals. Only one of the objects (NGC 3627) shows the contrary evidence. As determined by an analysis of resolved mass maps, the rest of the objects can not be included in the analysis because they belong to flocculent and multi-arm type of spiral arms, which are not described by density wave theory.

AB  - We present a relationship between spiral arm pitch angle (a measure of the tightness of spiral structure) and the mass of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the nuclei of disk galaxies. We argue that this relationship is expected through a combination of other relationships, whose existence has already been demonstrated. The recent discovery of AGN in bulgeless disk galaxies suggests that halo concentration or virial mass may be one of the determining factors in BH mass. Taken together with the result that mass concentration seems to determine spiral arm pitch angle, one would expect a relation to exist between spiral arm pitch angle and supermassive BH mass in disk galaxies, and we find that this is indeed the case. We conclude that this relationship may be important for estimating evolution in BH masses in disk galaxies out to intermediate redshifts, since regular spiral arm structure can be seen in galaxies out to z~=1.

AB  - We investigate the use of spiral arm pitch angles as a probe of disk galaxy mass profiles. We confirm our previous result that spiral arm pitch angles (P) are well correlated with the rate of shear (S) in disk galaxy rotation curves by using a much larger sample (51 galaxies) than used previously (17 galaxies). We use this correlation to argue that imaging data alone can provide a powerful probe of galactic mass distributions out to large look-back times. In contrast to previous work, we show that observed spiral arm pitch angles are similar when measured in the optical (at 0.4 mum) and the near-infrared (at 2.1 mum) with a mean difference of 2.3d+/-2.7d. This is then used to strengthen the known correlation between P and S using B-band images. We then use two example galaxies to demonstrate how an inferred shear rate coupled with a bulge-disk decomposition model and a Tully-Fisher-derived velocity normalization can be used to place constraints on a galaxy's baryon fraction and dark matter halo profile. We show that ESO 582-G12, a galaxy with a high shear rate (slightly declining rotation curve) at ~10 kpc, favors an adiabatically contracted halo, with high initial NFW concentration (cvir>16) and a high fraction of halo baryons in the form of stars (~15%-40%). In contrast, IC 2522 has a low shear rate (rising rotation curve) at ~10 kpc and favors nonadiabatically contracted models with low NFW concentrations (cvir~=2-8) and a low stellar baryon fraction <10%.

AB  - We present a sample of 33 galaxies for which we have calculated (i) the average rate of shear from published rotation curves, (ii) the far-infrared luminosity from IRAS fluxes, and (iii) the Ks-band luminosity from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). We show that a correlation exists between the shear rate and the ratio of the far-infrared to Ks-band luminosity. This ratio is essentially a measure of the star formation rate per unit mass, or the specific star formation rate. From this correlation we show that a critical shear rate exists, above which star formation would turn off in the discs of spiral galaxies. Using the correlation between shear rate and spiral arm pitch angle, this shear rate corresponds to the lowest pitch angles typically measured in near-infrared images of spiral galaxies.

AB  - We use a modified version of the halo-based group finder developed by Yang et al. to select galaxy groups from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR4). In the first step, a combination of two methods is used to identify the centers of potential groups and to estimate their characteristic luminosity. Using an iterative approach, the adaptive group finder then uses the average mass-to-light ratios of groups, obtained from the previous iteration, to assign a tentative mass to each group. This mass is then used to estimate the size and velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn is used to determine group membership in redshift space. Finally, each individual group is assigned two different halo masses: one based on its characteristic luminosity and the other based on its characteristic stellar mass. Applying the group finder to the SDSS DR4, we obtain 301,237 groups in a broad dynamic range, including systems of isolated galaxies. We use detailed mock galaxy catalogs constructed for the SDSS DR4 to test the performance of our group finder in terms of completeness of true members, contamination by interlopers, and accuracy of the assigned masses. This paper is the first in a series and focuses on the selection procedure, tests of the reliability of the group finder, and the basic properties of the group catalog (e.g., the mass-to-light ratios, the halo mass-to-stellar mass ratios). The group catalogs including the membership of the groups are available on request.

AB  - The origin of spiral patterns in galaxies is still not fully understood. Similar features also develop readily in N-body simulations of isolated cool, collisionless disks, yet even here the mechanism has yet to be explained. In this series of papers, I present a detailed study of the origin of spiral activity in simulations in the hope that the mechanism that causes the patterns is also responsible for some of these features galaxies. In this first paper, I use a suite of highly idealized simulations of a linearly stable disk that employ increasing numbers of particles. While the amplitudes of initial non-axisymmetric features scale as the inverse square root of the number of particles employed, the final amplitude of the patterns is independent of the particle number. I find that the amplitudes of non-axisymmetric disturbances grow in two distinct phases: slow growth occurs when the relative overdensity is below ~2%, but above this level the amplitude rises more rapidly. I show that all features, even of very low amplitude, scatter particles at the inner Lindblad resonance, changing the distribution of particles in the disk in such a way as to foster continued growth. Stronger scattering by larger amplitude waves provokes a vigorous instability that is a true linear mode of the modified disk.

AB  - A unified approach to spiral modes is carried out through the use of a cubic dispersion relationship developed earlier. This allows us to demonstrate the processes of maintenance and excitation of spiral modes of various morphologies separately for (a) normal spiral modes and (b) open spiral modes. In order to understand the relevant physical mechanisms and the general roles of the dynamical parameters (specified by the radial distribution of angular velocity, active surface density, and equivalent dispersive speed) the waves are described in terms of sustained wave trains. This allows us to examine the various dynamical issues discussed in Paper I. Very good accuracy is found when the present analytical results are compared with exact numerical data. The analytical approach makes it much easier to accomplish the process of identification of basic states from the observed spiral structure when a wide range of variation of the parameters of the basic state is involved. Our characterization of parameter regimes in terms of a few simple algebraic relations will be a useful guide for the construction of detailed quantitative models of specific galaxies and for general numerical surveys of classes of galaxies of given morphological types.

AB  - The viability of the modal approach to global spiral structures in galaxies of all Hubble morphological types is demonstrated by identifying the appropriate basic states of galaxy models from the dynamical point of view and demonstrating their compatibility with observations from the physical point of view. It is shown that barred spiral modes are likely to occur for relatively large disk masses. It is shown that, for normal spirals of small pitch angle, the gaseous component plays an essential role, both in the excitation of the unstable spiral modes and in the stable maintenance of the final spiral structure. A cubic dispersion relationship is used to study spiral modes and demonstrate the processes of maintenance and excitation of the modes of various morphologies separately for normal spiral modes and open spiral modes. The waves are described in terms of sustained wave trains in order to understand the relevant physical mechanisms and the general role of the dynamical parameters.

AB  - Supervised artificial neural networks are used to predict useful properties of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, in this instance morphological classifications, spectral types and redshifts. By giving the trained networks unseen data, it is found that correlations between predicted and actual properties are around 0.9 with rms errors of order ten per cent. Thus, given a representative training set, these properties may be reliably estimated for galaxies in the survey for which there are no spectra and without human intervention.

AB  - We describe Ganalyzer, a model-based tool that can automatically analyze and classify galaxy images. Ganalyzer works by separating the galaxy pixels from the background pixels, finding the center and radius of the galaxy, generating the radial intensity plot, and then computing the slopes of the peaks detected in the radial intensity plot to measure the spirality of the galaxy and determine its morphological class. Unlike algorithms that are based on machine learning, Ganalyzer is based on measuring the spirality of the galaxy, a task that is difficult to perform manually, and in many cases can provide a more accurate analysis compared to manual observation. Ganalyzer is simple to use, and can be easily embedded into other image analysis applications. Another advantage is its speed, which allows it to analyze ~10,000,000 galaxy images in five days using a standard modern desktop computer. These capabilities can make Ganalyzer a useful tool in analyzing large data sets of galaxy images collected by autonomous sky surveys such as SDSS, LSST, or DES. The software is available for free download at http://vfacstaff.ltu.edu/lshamir/downloads/ganalyzer, and the data used in the experiment are available at http://vfacstaff.ltu.edu/lshamir/downloads/ganalyzer/GalaxyImages.zip.

AB  - From a survey of all published rotation curves, it is found that in general a galaxy shows a global spiral pattern either by maintaining nearly solid-body rotation throughout the region of the spiral pattern, or by having a density-wave driving mechanism in the form of a bar or a companion. It is reported that of the 54 galaxies studied, 21 have neither bars nor companions. Of these, nine rotate differentially but lack global patterns, while 10 have global patterns ending where the rotation curve becomes flat. In the latter galaxies the absence of an inner Lindblad resonance, which results from the nearly rigid rotation, greatly simplifies the problem of creating waves by means of disk instabilities. Finally, criteria for identifying oval distortions are discussed and examples are illustrated.

AB  - A 12-division morphological system emphasizing arm continuity, length and symmetry has been developed for the classification of all spiral galaxies according to the regularity of their spiral arm structure. Arm classifications were tabulated for 305 barred and nonbarred spiral galaxies; of these, 79 are isolated, 52 are binary and 174 are in groups. Among the isolated SA galaxies, 68 + or - 10% have irregular and fragmented, or 'flocculent', spiral structures. Only 32 + or - 10% have symmetric spiral arms in the classic grand design pattern. Flocculent spirals are the most common structures of galaxies without companions or bars. Since flocculent galaxies may have bars and companions, and grand design galaxies may have neither bars nor companions, such perturbations are neither perfectly effective nor always necessary in the driving of grand design patterns.

AB  - We propose a new dynamical picture of galactic stellar and gas spirals, based on hydrodynamic simulations in a "live" stellar disk. We focus especially on spiral structures excited in an isolated galactic disk without a stellar bar. Using high-resolution, three-dimensional N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations, we found that the spiral features of the gas in galactic disks are formed by essentially different mechanisms from the galactic shock in stellar density waves. The stellar spiral arms and the interstellar matter on average corotate in a galactic potential at any radii. Unlike the stream motions in the galactic shock, the interstellar matter flows into the local potential minima with irregular motions. The flows converge to form dense gas clouds/filaments near the bottom of the stellar spirals, whose global structures resemble dust lanes seen in late-type spiral galaxies. The stellar arms are non-steady; they are wound and stretched by the galactic shear, and thus local densities of the arm change on a timescale of ~100 Myr, due to bifurcating or merging with other arms. This makes the gas spirals associated with the stellar arms non-steady. The association of dense gas clouds is eventually dissolved into inter-arm regions with non-circular motions. Star clusters are formed from the cold, dense gases, whose ages are less than ~30 Myr, and they are roughly associated with the background stellar arms without a clear spatial offset between gas spiral arms and distribution of young stars.

AB  - In order to understand the physical mechanisms underlying non-steady stellar spiral arms in disk galaxies, we analyzed the growing and damping phases of their spiral arms using three-dimensional N-body simulations. We confirmed that the spiral arms are formed due to a swing amplification mechanism that reinforces density enhancement as a seeded wake. In the damping phase, the Coriolis force exerted on a portion of the arm surpasses the gravitational force that acts to shrink the portion. Consequently, the stars in the portion escape from the arm, and subsequently they form a new arm at a different location. The time-dependent nature of the spiral arms originates in the continual repetition of this nonlinear phenomenon. Since a spiral arm does not rigidly rotate, but follows the galactic differential rotation, the stars in the arm rotate at almost the same rate as the arm. In other words, every single position in the arm can be regarded as the corotation point. Due to interaction with their host arms, the energy and angular momentum of the stars change, thereby causing radial migration of the stars. During this process, the kinetic energy of random motion (random energy) of the stars does not significantly increase, and the disk remains dynamically cold. Owing to this low degree of disk heating, short-lived spiral arms can recurrently develop over many rotational periods. The resultant structure of the spiral arms in the N-body simulations is consistent with the observational nature of spiral galaxies. We conclude that the formation and structure of spiral arms in isolated disk galaxies can be reasonably understood by nonlinear interactions between a spiral arm and its constituent stars.

AB  - We report the discovery of H I 21 cm absorption toward the well-studied Gigahertz peaked spectrum source CTA 21 (4C 16.09) using the Arecibo telescope on 2009 September 20 and 21. Recently, the frequency band between 700 and 800 MHz was temporarily opened up to radio astronomy when US TV stations were mandated to switch from analog to digital transmissions, with new frequency allocations. The redshifted H I frequency for CTA 21 falls within this band. CTA 21 has a complex radio structure on a range of scales. The innermost prominent components are separated by ~12 mas while weak diffuse emission extends for up to ~300 mas. The H I absorption profile that we find has two main components, one narrow and the other wider and blueshifted. The total H I column density is 7.9 × 1020 cm-2, assuming a covering factor of unity and a spin temperature of 100 K. This H I absorption confirms the recently determined optical redshift of this faint galaxy of z ~ 0.907. We discuss this new detection in light of H I absorption studies toward compact radio sources, and also the possibility that CTA 21 may be exhibiting multiple cycles of nuclear activity. This new detection in CTA 21 is consistent with a strong trend for detection of H I absorption in radio galaxies with evidence of episodic nuclear/jet activity.

AB  - We used the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) to study the mid-IR properties and investigate the energetics of 24 Submillimeter Galaxies (SMGs). This is the largest sample of SMGs observed with Spitzer IRS and covers the full extent of properties of the radio-identified population of SMGs in the redshift range of z ~ 0.65-3.2. We observe broad emission features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in more than 80% of our sample. We find that the median mid-IR spectrum is well described by a starburst component with an additional power law, F nu ~ nu-2, likely representing a <32% contribution from an active galactic nucleus to the bolometric luminosity. Our results thus confirm that starburst activity dominates the bolometric luminosity in SMGs. We find that SMGs show weaker silicate absorption at ~9.7 mum than local ULIRGs. We also find stronger 6.2-mum PAH emission in SMGs (relative to the 7.7 mum PAH feature) than in local nuclear starbursts, which may be attributed to lower extinction by ice along the line of sight to SMGs. This suggests that the continuum and PAH emitting regions of SMGs are less obscured than in local starbursts and similarly luminous low-redshift ULIRGs. We interpret these results as evidence for a more extended distribution of cool and warm dust in SMGs compared to the more compact emitting regions in local ULIRGs and starbursts. Together these results suggest that SMGs are not simple high-redshift analogs of nuclear starbursts or local ULIRGs, but instead they appear to have star formation which resembles that seen in less-extreme star-forming environments at z ~ 0-suggesting their intense activity is distributed across a far larger region than the ~1 kpc nuclear bursts in local ULIRGs.

AB  - We attempt to measure possible miscalibration of the wavelength scale of the VLT-UVES spectrograph. We take spectra of QSO HE0515-4414 through the UVES iodine cell which contains thousands of well-calibrated iodine lines and compare these lines to the wavelength scale from the standard thorium-argon pipeline calibration. Analyzing three exposures of this z = 1.71 QSO, we find two distinct types of calibration shifts needed to correct the Th/Ar wavelength scale. First, there is an overall average velocity shift of between 100 m s-1 and 500 m s-1 depending upon the exposure. Second, within a given exposure, we find intra-order velocity distortions of 100 m s-1 up to more than 200 m s-1. These calibration errors are similar to, but smaller than, those found earlier in the Keck HIRES spectrometer. We discuss the possible origins of these two types of miscalibration. We also explore the implications of these calibration errors on the systematic error in measurements of Delta alpha \over alpha, the change in the fine-structure constant derived from measurement of the relative redshifts of absorption lines in QSO absorption systems. The overall average, exposure-dependent shifts should be less relevant for fine-structure work, but the intra-order shifts have the potential to affect these results. Using either our measured calibration offsets or a Gaussian model with sigma of around 90 m s-1, Monte Carlo mock experiments find errors in Delta alpha \over alpha of between 1 × 10-6 N -1/2 sys and 3 × 10-6 N -1/2 sys, where N sys is the number of systems used and the range is due to dependence on how many metallic absorption lines in each system are compared.

AB  - We previously reported Keck telescope observations suggesting a smaller value of the fine structure constant alpha at high redshift. New Very Large Telescope (VLT) data, probing a different direction in the Universe, shows an inverse evolution; alpha increases at high redshift. Although the pattern could be due to as yet undetected systematic effects, with the systematics as presently understood the combined data set fits a spatial dipole, significant at the 4.2sigma level, in the direction right ascension 17.5$\pm$0.9 h, declination -58$\pm$9 deg. The independent VLT and Keck samples give consistent dipole directions and amplitudes, as do high and low redshift samples. A search for systematics, using observations duplicated at both telescopes, reveals none so far which emulate this result.

AB  - In an effort to resolve the discrepancy between two measurements of the fundamental constant mu, the proton to electron mass ratio, at early times in the universe we reanalyze the same data used in the earlier studies. Our analysis of the molecular hydrogen absorption lines in archival Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visible Echelle Spectrometer (UVES) spectra of the damped Lyman alpha systems in the quasi-stellar objects Q0347-383 and Q0405-443 yields a combined measurement of a Deltamu/mu value of (-7 $\pm$ 8) × 10-6, consistent with no change in the value of mu over a time span of 11.5 Gyr. Here, we define Deltamu as (mu z  - mu0) where mu z  is the value of mu at a redshift of z and mu0 is the present-day value. Our null result is consistent with the recent measurements of King et al., Deltamu/mu = (2.6 $\pm$ 3.0) × 10-6, and inconsistent with the positive detection of a change in mu by Reinhold et al. Both of the previous studies and this study are based on the same data but with differing analysis methods. Improvements in the wavelength calibration over the UVES pipeline calibration is a key element in both of the null results. This leads to the conclusion that the fundamental constant mu is unchanged to an accuracy of 10-5 over the last 80% of the age of the universe, well into the matter dominated epoch. This limit provides constraints on models of dark energy that invoke rolling scalar fields and also limits the parameter space of supersymmetric or string theory models of physics. New instruments, both planned and under construction, will provide opportunities to greatly improve the accuracy of these measurements.

AB  - We summarize the attempts by our group and others to derive constraints on variations of fundamental constants over cosmic time using quasar absorption lines. Most upper limits reside in the range 0.5-1.5×10-5 at the 3 sigma level over a redshift range of approximately 0.5-2.5 for the fine-structure constant, alpha, the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu and a combination of the proton gyromagnetic factor and the two previous constants, g p( alpha 2/ mu) nu , for only one claimed variation of alpha. It is therefore very important to perform new measurements to improve the sensitivity of the numerous methods to at least <0.1×10-5 which should be possible in the next few years. Future instrumentations on ELTs in the optical and/or ALMA, EVLA and SKA pathfinders in the radio will undoutedly boost this field by allowing to reach much better signal-to-noise ratios at higher spectral resolution and to perform measurements on molecules in the ISM of high redshift galaxies.

AB  - We investigate constraints on the time variation of the fine structure constant between the recombination epoch and the present epoch, Deltaalpha/alpha≡(alpharec-alphanow)/alphanow, from cosmic microwave background (CMB) taking into account simultaneous variation of other physical constants, namely the electron mass me and the proton mass mp. In other words, we consider the variation of Yukawa coupling and the QCD scale LambdaQCD in addition to the electromagnetic coupling. We clarify which parameters can be determined from CMB temperature anisotropy in terms of singular value decomposition. Assuming a relation among variations of coupling constants governed by a single scalar field (the dilaton), the 95 % confidence level (C.L.) constraint on Deltaalpha/alpha is found to be -8.28 × 10-3 < Deltaalpha/alpha < 1.81 × 10-3, which is tighter than the one obtained by considering only the change of alpha and me. We also obtain the constraint on the time variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio mu≡mp/me to be -0.52 < Deltamu/mu < 0.17 (95 % C.L.) under the same assumption. Finally, we also implement a forecast for constraints from the PLANCK survey.

AB  - The Keck telescope's High Resolution Spectrograph (HIRES) has previously provided evidence for a smaller fine-structure constant, alpha , compared to the current laboratory value, in a sample of 143 quasar absorption systems: hbox \Delta\alpha/\alpha=(-0.57$\pm$0.11)×10-5. The analysis was based on a variety of metal-ion transitions which, if alpha varies, experience different relative velocity shifts. This result is yet to be robustly contradicted, or confirmed, by measurements on other telescopes and spectrographs; it remains crucial to do so. It is also important to consider new possible instrumental systematic effects which may explain the Keck/HIRES results. \citet[][arXiv:0904.4725v1]GriestK_09a recently identified distortions in the echelle order wavelength scales of HIRES with typical amplitudes $\pm$250 m s-1. Here we investigate the effect such distortions may have had on the Keck/HIRES varying alpha  results. Using a simple model of these intra-order distortions, we demonstrate that they cause a random effect on Delta alpha /alpha  from absorber to absorber because the systems are at different redshifts, placing the relevant absorption lines at different positions in different echelle orders. The typical magnitude of the effect on Delta alpha /alpha  is ˜ 0.4×10-5 for individual absorbers which, compared to the median error on Delta alpha /alpha  in the sample, ˜ 1.9×10-5, is relatively small. Consequently, the weighted mean value changes by less than 0.05×10-5 if the corrections we calculate are applied. Unsurprisingly, with corrections this small, we do not find direct evidence that applying them is actually warranted. Nevertheless, we urge caution, particularly for analyses aiming to achieve high precision Delta alpha /alpha measurements on individual systems or small samples, that a much more detailed understanding of such intra-order distortions and their dependence on observational parameters is important if they are to be avoided or modelled reliably.

AB  - The ammonia method, recently proposed by Flambaum and Kozlov (2007) to probe variations of the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu=m/m, is applied for the first time to dense prestellar molecular clouds in the Milky Way, allowing to test Deltamu/mu at different galactocentric distances. High quality radio-astronomical observations are used to check the presence of possible relative radial velocity offsets between the inversion transition of NH3(J,K)=(1,1), and the CCS J=2-1 and N2H+J=1-0 rotational transitions. Carefully selected sample of 21 NH3/CCS pairs observed in the Perseus molecular cloud provide the offset DeltaV=36$\pm$7$\pm$13.5ms-1. A similar offset of DeltaV=40.8$\pm$12.9ms-1 between NH3(J,K)=(1,1) and N2H+J=1-0 has been found in an isolated dense core L183 by Pagani et al. (2009). Overall these observations provide a safe bound of a maximum offset between ammonia and the other molecules at the level of DeltaV<=100m s-1. Being interpreted in terms of Deltamu/mu, this bound corresponds to Deltamu/mu<=1×10-7, which is an order of magnitude more sensitive than available extragalactic constraints. Taken at face value the measured DeltaV shows positive shifts between the line centers of NH3 and these two other molecules and suggest a real offset, which would imply a Deltamu/mu˜4×10-8. If Deltamu/mu follows the gradient of the local gravitational potential, then the obtained results are in conflict with laboratory atomic clock experiments in the solar system by ˜5 orders of magnitude, thus requiring a chameleon-type scalar field model. New measurements involving other molecules and a wider range of objects along with verification of molecular rest frequencies are currently planned to confirm these first indications.

AB  - The Single Ion Differential alpha Measurement (SIDAM)method for measuring Deltaalpha/alpha and its figures of merit are illustrated together withthe results produced by means of Fe ii absorption linesof QSO intervening systems. The method providesDeltaalpha/alpha = -0.12 $\pm$1.79 ppm (parts-per-million) at zabs = 1.15towards HE 0515-4414 and Deltaalpha/alpha = 5.66$\pm$2.67 ppm at zabs = 1.84towards Q 1101-264, which are so far the most accurate measurementsfor single systems. SIDAM analysis for 3 systems from the Chand et al. [1]sample provides inconsistent results which we interpret as due tocalibration errors of the Chand et al. data at the level ≈10 ppm.In one system evidence for photo-ionization Dopplershift between Mg ii and Fe ii lines is found.This evidence has important bearings on the Many Multipletmethod where the signal for Deltaalpha/alphavariabilityis carried mainly by systems involving Mg ii absorbers.Some correlations are also found in the Murphy et al. [10] sample which suggestlarger errors than previously reported.Thus, we consider unlikely that both the Chand et al.and Murphy et al. datasets could providean estimate of Deltaalpha/alpha with an accuracy at the level of 1 ppm.A new spectrograph like the ESPRESSO projectwill be crucial to make progress in the astronomical determination of Deltaalpha/alpha.

AB  - Molecular transitions recently discovered at redshift zabs = 2.059 towards the bright background quasar J2123-0050 are analysed to limit cosmological variation in the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu ≡ mp/me. Observed with the Keck telescope, the optical echelle spectrum has the highest resolving power and largest number (86) of H2 transitions in such analyses so far. Also, (seven) HD transitions are used for the first time to constrain mu-variation. These factors, and an analysis employing the fewest possible free parameters, strongly constrain mu's relative deviation from the current laboratory value: Deltamu/mu = (+5.6 +/- 5.5stat +/- 2.9sys) × 10-6, indicating an insignificantly larger mu in the absorber. This is the first Keck result to complement recent null constraints from three systems at zabs > 2.5 observed with the Very Large Telescope. The main possible systematic errors stem from wavelength calibration uncertainties. In particular, distortions in the wavelength solution on echelle order scales are estimated to contribute approximately half the total systematic error component, but our estimate is model dependent and may therefore under or overestimate the real effect, if present.  To assist future mu-variation analyses of this kind, and other astrophysical studies of H2 in general, we provide a compilation of the most precise laboratory wavelengths and calculated parameters important for absorption-line work with H2 transitions redwards of the hydrogen Lyman limit.

AB  - Aims: We probe the dependence of alpha2/mu on the ambient matter density by means of spectral observations in submm- and mm-wave bands.  Methods: A procedure is suggested for exploring the value of F = alpha2/mu, where mu = me/mp is the electron-to-proton mass ratio, and alpha = e2/(hbar c) is the fine-structure constant. The fundamental physical constants, which are measured in different physical environments of high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar) densities of baryonic matter are supposed to vary in chameleon-like scalar field models, which predict that both masses and coupling constant may depend on the local matter density. The parameter DeltaF/F = (Fobs - Flab)/Flab can be estimated from the radial velocity offset, DeltaV = Vrot - Vfs, between the low-laying rotational transitions in carbon monoxide 13CO and the fine-structure transitions in atomic carbon [C i]. A model-dependent constraint on Deltaalpha/alpha can be obtained from DeltaF/F using Deltamu/mu independently measured from the ammonia method.  Results: Currently available radio astronomical datasets provide an upper limit on |DeltaV| < 110 m s-1 (1sigma). When interpreted in terms of the spatial variation of F, this gives |DeltaF/F| < 3.7 × 10-7. An order of magnitude improvement in this limit will allow us to independently test a non-zero value of Deltamu/mu = (2.2 $\pm$ 0.4stat $\pm$ 0.3sys) × 10-8, recently found with the ammonia method. Considering that the ammonia method restricts the spatial variation of mu at the level of |Deltamu/mu| <= 3 × 10-8 and assuming that DeltaF/F is the same in the entire interstellar medium, one obtains that the spatial variation of alpha does not exceed the value |Deltaalpha/alpha| < 2 × 10-7. Since extragalactic gas clouds have similar densities to those in the interstellar medium, the bound on Deltaalpha/alpha is also expected to be less than 2 × 10-7 at high redshift if no significant temporal dependence of alpha is present.

AB  - Spatial and temporal variations in the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu , and in the fine-structure constant, alpha , are predicted in non-Standard models aimed to explain the nature of dark energy. Among them the so-called chameleon-like scalar field models predict strong dependence of masses and coupling constants on the local matter density. To explore such models we estimated the parameters Delta  mu /mu  equiv (mu_obs  - mu_lab )/mu_lab  and Delta  alpha /alpha  equiv  (alpha_obs - alpha_lab )/alpha_lab  in two essentially different environments, - terrestrial (high density) and interstellar (low density), - from radio astronomical observations of cold prestellar molecular cores in the disk of the Milky Way. We found that Delta mu /mu  = (22$\pm$4_stat$\pm$3_sys)×10-9, and |Delta  alpha /alpha | < 1.1×10-7. If only a conservative upper limit is considered, then |Delta mu /mu | < 3×10-8. We also reviewed and re-analyzed the available data on the cosmological variation of alpha  obtained from Fe I and Fe II systems in optical spectra of quasars. We show that statistically significant evidence for the changing alpha  at the level of 10-6 has not been provided so far. The most stringent constraint on |Delta  alpha /alpha | < 2×10-6 was found from the Fe II system at z = 1.15 towards the bright quasar HE 0515-4414. The limit of 2×10-6 corresponds to the utmost accuracy which can be reached with available to date optical facilities.

AB  - Quantum-mechanical tunneling inversion transition in ammonia (NH3) is actively used as a sensitive tool to study possible variations of the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu = m e/m p. The molecule H3O+ has the inversion barrier significantly lower than that of NH3. Consequently, its tunneling transition occurs in the far-infrared (FIR) region and mixes with rotational transitions. Several such FIR and submillimeter transitions are observed from the interstellar medium in the Milky Way and in nearby galaxies. We show that the rest-frame frequencies of these transitions are very sensitive to the variation of mu, and that their sensitivity coefficients have different signs. Thus, H3O+ can be used as an independent target to test hypothetical changes in mu measured at different ambient conditions of high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar medium) matter densities. The environmental dependence of mu and coupling constants is suggested in a class of chameleon-type scalar field models---candidates to dark energy carrier.

AB  - Lambda -doublet spectra of light diatomic radicals have high sensitivity to the possible variations in the fine-structure constant alpha  and electron-to-proton mass ratio  beta . For molecules OH and CH sensitivity is further enhanced because of the  J -dependent decoupling of the electron spin from the molecular axis, where  J  is total angular momentum of the molecule. When  Lambda -splitting has different signs in two limiting coupling cases  a  and  b , decoupling of the spin leads to the change in sign of the splitting and to the growth of the dimensionless sensitivity coefficients. For example, sensitivity coefficients for the  Lambda -doublet lines  J=(9)/(2)  of the  Pi1/2  state of OH molecule are on the order of 103 .

AB  - Recent attempts to constrain cosmological variation in the fine structure constant, alpha , using quasar absorption lines have yielded two statistical samples which initially appear to be inconsistent. One of these samples was subsequently demonstrated to not pass consistency tests; it appears that the optimisation algorithm used to fit the model to the spectra failed. Nevertheless, the results of the other hinge on the robustness of the spectral fitting program VPFIT, which has been tested through simulation but not through direct exploration of the likelihood function. We present the application of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to this problem, and demonstrate that VPFIT produces similar values and uncertainties for Delta alpha /alpha , the fractional change in the fine structure constant, as our MCMC algorithm, and thus that VPFIT is reliable.

AB  - We present a strong constraint on variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio mu over cosmological time scales using molecular hydrogen transitions in optical quasar spectra. Using high quality spectra of quasars Q0405-443, Q0347-383, and Q0528-250, variation in mu relative to the present day value is limited to Deltamu/mu=(2.6$\pm$3.0)×10-6. We reduce systematic errors compared to previous works by substantially improving the spectral wavelength calibration method and by fitting absorption profiles to the forest of hydrogen Lyman alpha transitions surrounding each H2 transition. Our results are consistent with no variation, and inconsistent with a previous ≈4sigma detection of mu variation involving Q0405-443 and Q0347-383. If the results of this work and those suggesting that alpha may be varying are both correct, then this would tend to disfavor certain grand unification models.

AB  - Based on measurements with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope, a multi-line study of molecular species is presented toward the gravitational lens system PKS 1830-211, which is by far the best known target to study dense cool gas in absorption at intermediate redshift. Determining average radial velocities and performing Large Velocity Gradient radiative transfer calculations, the aims of this study are (1) to determine the density of the gas, (2) to constrain the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and (3) to evaluate the proton-to-electron mass ratio at redshift z ˜ 0.89. Analyzing data from six rotational HC3N transitions (this includes the J=7<=ftarrow6 line, which is likely detected for the first time in the interstellar medium) we obtain n(H2) ~ 2600 cm-3 for the gas density of the south-western absorption component, assuming a background source covering factor, which is independent of frequency. With a possibly more realistic frequency dependence proportional to nu0.5 (the maximal exponent permitted by observational boundary conditions), n(H2) ~ 1700 cm-3. Again toward the south-western source, excitation temperatures of molecular species with optically thin lines and higher rotational constants are, on average, consistent with the expected temperature of the cosmic microwave background, T_CMB = 5.14 K. However, individually, there is a surprisingly large scatter which far surpasses expected uncertainties. A comparison of CS J =1 <=ftarrow0 and 4<=ftarrow3 optical depths toward the weaker north-western absorption component results in T_ex = 11 K and a 1-sigma error of 3 K. For the main component, a comparison of velocities determined from ten optically thin NH3 inversion lines with those from five optically thin rotational transitions of HC3N, observed at similar frequencies, constrains potential variations of the proton-to-electron mass ratio mu to Deltamu / mu < 1.4 × 10 -6 with 3-sigma confidence. Also including optically thin rotational lines from other molecular species, it is emphasized that systematic errors are Delta V < 1 km s-1, corresponding to Deltamu/mu< 1.0× 10-6.

AB  - We review recent activity searching for variations in the fundamental constants of nature in quasar absorption spectra and in the laboratory. While research in this direction has been ongoing for many decades, the topic has recently been stimulated by astronomical evidence for spatial variation in the fine-structure constant, alpha. This result could be confirmed using different quasar data and atomic clock measurements, but there are significant challenges to obtain the required accuracy. We review existing measurements and discuss some of the most promising systems where any variations would be strongly enhanced.

AB  - Indications of spatial variation of the fine-structure constant, alpha, based on study of quasar absorption systems have recently been reported [J. K. Webb, J. A. King, M. T. Murphy, V. V. Flambaum, R. F. Carswell, and M. B. Bainbridge, arXiv:1008.3907.]. The physics that causes this alpha-variation should have other observable manifestations, and this motivates us to look for complementary astrophysical effects. In this paper we propose a method to test whether spatial variation of fundamental constants existed during the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis and study existing measurements of deuterium abundance for a signal. We also examine existing quasar absorption spectra data that are sensitive to variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio mu and x=alpha2mugp for spatial variation.

AB  - Speculation that the fine-structure constant alpha varies in spacetime has a long history. We derive, in 4-D general relativity and in isotropic coordinates, the solution for a charged spherical black hole according to the framework for dynamical alpha J. D. Bekenstein, Phys. Rev. DPRVDAQ0556-2821 25, 1527 (1982).10.1103/PhysRevD.25.1527. This solution coincides with a previously known one-parameter extension of the dilatonic black hole family. Among the notable properties of varying-alpha charged black holes are adherence to a ``no hair'' principle, the absence of the inner (Cauchy) horizon of the Reissner-Nordström black holes, the nonexistence of precisely extremal black holes, and the appearance of naked singularities in an analytic extension of the relevant metric. The exteriors of almost extremal electrically (magnetically) charged black holes have simple structures which makes their influence on applied magnetic (electric) fields transparent. We rederive the thermodynamic functions of the modified black holes; the otherwise difficult calculation of the electric potential is done by a shortcut. We confirm that variability of alpha in the wake of expansion of the universe does not threaten the generalized second law.

AB  - We investigate the sample of 213 GPS sources selected from simultaneous multi-frequency 1-22 GHz observations obtained with RATAN-600 radio telescope. We use publicly available data to characterize parsec-scale structure of the selected sources. Among them we found 121 core dominated sources, 76 Compact Symmetric Object (CSO) candidates (24 of them are highly probable), 16 sources have complex parsec-scale morphology. Most of GPS galaxies are characterized by CSO-type morphology and lower observed peak frequency (about 1.8 GHz). Most of GPS quasars are characterized by core-jet type morphology and higher observed peak frequency (about 3.6 GHz). This is in good agreement with previous results. However, we found a number of sources for which the general relation CSO -- galaxy, core-jet -- quasar does not hold. These sources deserve detailed investigation. Assuming simple synchrotron model of a homogeneous cloud we estimate characteristic magnetic field in parsec-scale components of GPS sources to be about 10 mG.

AB  - We compare accretion and black hole spin as potential energy sources for outbursts from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Based on our adopted spin model, we find that the distribution of AGN power estimated from X-ray cavities is consistent with a broad range of both spin parameters and accretion rates. Sufficient quantities of molecular gas are available in most BCGs to power their AGNs by accretion alone. However, we find no correlation between AGN power and molecular gas mass over the range of jet power considered here. For a given AGN power, the BCG's gas mass and accretion efficiency, defined as the fraction of the available cold molecular gas that is required to power the AGN, both vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Most of the molecular gas in BCGs is apparently consumed by star formation or is driven out of the nucleus by the AGN before it reaches the nuclear black hole. Bondi accretion from hot atmospheres is generally unable to fuel powerful AGNs, unless their black holes are more massive than their bulge luminosities imply. We identify several powerful AGNs that reside in relatively gas-poor galaxies, indicating an unusually efficient mode of accretion, or that their AGNs are powered by another mechanism. If these systems are powered primarily by black hole spin rather than by accretion, spin must also be tapped efficiently in some systems, i.e., P_jet > Mc^2, or their black hole masses must be substantially larger than the values implied by their bulge luminosities. We constrain the (model-dependent) accretion rate at the transition from radiatively inefficient to radiatively efficient accretion flows to be a few percent of the Eddington rate, a value that is consistent with other estimates.

AB  - We present analytic calculations of angular momentum transport and gas inflow in galaxies, from scales of ˜ kpc to deep inside the potential of a central massive black hole (BH). We compare these analytic calculations to numerical simulations and use them to develop a sub-grid model of BH growth that can be incorporated into semi-analytic calculations or cosmological simulations. Motivated by both analytic calculations and simulations of gas inflow in galactic nuclei, we argue that the strongest torque on gas arises when non-axisymmetric perturbations to the stellar gravitational potential produce orbit crossings and shocks in the gas. This is true both at large radii ˜0.01-1 kpc, where bar-like stellar modes dominate the non-axisymmetric potential, and at smaller radii ≲10 pc, where a lopsided/eccentric stellar disc dominates. The traditional orbit-crossing criterion is not always adequate to predict the locations of, and inflow due to, shocks in gas+stellar discs with finite sound speeds. We derive a modified criterion that predicts the presence of shocks in stellar-dominated systems even absent formal orbit crossing. We then derive analytic expressions for the loss of angular momentum and the resulting gas inflow rates in the presence of such shocks. We test our analytic predictions using hydrodynamic simulations at a range of galactic scales, and show that they successfully predict the mass inflow rates and quasi-steady gas surface densities with a small scatter ~=0.3 dex. We use our analytic results to construct a new estimate of the BH accretion rate given galaxy properties at larger radii, for use in galaxy and cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. While highly simplified, this accretion rate predictor captures the key scalings in the numerical simulations. By contrast, alternate estimates such as the local viscous accretion rate or the spherical Bondi rate fail systematically to reproduce the simulations and have significantly larger scatter.

AB  - We present new deep Very Large Telescope (VLT)/FORS optical spectra with intermediate resolution and large wavelength coverage of the compact radio source and ultra-luminous IR galaxy (ULIRG) PKS 1345+12 (4C 12.50; z= 0.122), taken with the aim of investigating the impact of the nuclear activity on the circumnuclear interstellar medium (ISM). PKS 1345+12 is a powerful quasar [L(Hbeta)NLR˜ 1042 erg s-1] and is also the best studied case of an emission line outflow in a ULIRG. Using the density-sensitive transauroral emission lines [S II]4068,4076 and [O II]7318,7319,7330,7331, we pilot a new technique to accurately model the electron density for cases in which it is not possible to use the traditional diagnostic [S II]6716/6731, namely sources with highly broadened complex emission line profiles and/or high (Ne≳ 104 cm-3) electron densities. We measure electron densities of Ne= (2.94+0.71-1.03) × 103 cm-3, Ne= (1.47+0.60-0.47) × 104 cm-3 and Ne= (3.16+1.66-1.01) × 105 cm-3 for the regions emitting the narrow, broad and very broad components, respectively. We therefore calculate a total mass outflow rate of ? M&sun; yr-1, similar to the range estimated for another compact radio source, PKS 1549-79. We estimate the total mass in the warm gas outflow is Mtotal= (8+3-3) × 105 M&sun; with filling factors of ε= (4.4+1.8-1.5) × 10-4 and ε= (1.6+0.7-0.5) × 10-7 for the regions emitting the broad and very broad components, respectively. The total kinetic power in the warm outflow is ? erg s-1. Taking the black hole properties published by Dasyra et al., we find that only a small fraction [?] of the available accretion power is driving the warm outflow in PKS 1345+12, which is significantly less than that currently required by the majority of quasar feedback models (˜5-10 per cent of Lbol), but similar to the recent suggestion of Hopkins & Elvis if a two-stage feedback model is implemented (˜0.5 per cent of Lbol). The models also predict that active galactic nuclei (AGN)-driven outflows will eventually remove the gas from the bulge of the host galaxy. Our observations show that the visible warm outflow in PKS 1345+12 is not currently capable of doing so. However, it is entirely possible that much of the outflow is either obscured by a dense and dusty natal cocoon and/or in cooler or hotter phases of the ISM. This result is important not just for studies of young Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum/Compact Steep Spectrum radio sources, but for AGN in general.

AB  - Using Chandra imaging spectroscopy and Very Large Array L-band maps, we have identified radio galaxies at P (1.4 GHz)>= 3 × 1023 W Hz-1 and X-ray point sources (XPSs) at L (0.3-8 keV)>= 1042 erg s-1 in 11 moderate redshift (0.2 < z < 0.4) clusters of galaxies. Each cluster is uniquely chosen to have a total mass similar to predicted progenitors of the present-day Coma Cluster. Within a projected radius of 1 Mpc we detect 20 radio galaxies and 8 XPSs (three sources are detected in both X-ray and radio) confirmed to be cluster members above these limits. Of these, 75% are detected within 500 kpc (projected) of the cluster center. This result is inconsistent with a random selection from bright, red sequence ellipticals at the >99.999% level. We suggest that these active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are triggered somehow by the intracluster medium (ICM), perhaps similar to the Bondi accretion model of Allen et al. All but one of the XPSs are hosted by luminous ellipticals which otherwise show no other evidence for AGN activity. These objects are unlikely to be highly obscured AGN since there is no evidence for large amounts of X-ray or optical absorption. One XPS, in addition to possessing a pure absorption-line optical spectrum, has a large excess of light blueward of the Ca II H&K break that could be nonthermal emission; a second XPS host galaxy probably has excess blue light. The most viable model for these sources are low-luminosity BL Lac Objects, similar to the high-energy-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs) discovered in abundance in serendipitous X-ray surveys. The expected numbers of lower luminosity FR 1 radio galaxies and HBLs in our sample converge to suggest that very deep radio and X-ray images of rich clusters will detect AGN (either X-ray or radio emitting or both) in a large fraction of bright elliptical galaxies in the inner 500 kpc. Because both the radio galaxies and the XPSs possess relativistic jets, they (and, by extension, the entire radio luminosity function) can inject heat into the ICM. Using the most recent scalings of P jet vprop L 0.5  r  from Bîrzan et al., radio sources weaker than our luminosity limit probably contribute the majority of the heat to the ICM. Also, because these heat sources move around the cluster, AGN heating is distributed rather evenly. If a majority of ICM heating is due to large numbers of low-power radio sources, triggered into activity by the increasing ICM density as they move inward, this may be the feedback mechanism necessary to stabilize cooling in cluster cores.

AB  - Recent work on the engines of active galactic nuclei jets suggests that their power depends strongly and perhaps counter-intuitively on black hole spin. We explore the consequences of this on the radio-loud population of active galactic nuclei and find that the time evolution of the most powerful radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars fits into a picture in which black hole spin varies from retrograde to prograde with respect to the accreting material. Unlike the current view, according to which jet powers decrease in tandem with a global downsizing effect, we argue for a drop in jet power resulting directly from the paucity of retrograde accretion systems at lower redshift z caused by a continuous history of accretion dating back to higher z. In addition, the model provides simple interpretations for the basic spectral features differentiating radio-loud and radio-quiet objects, such as the presence or absence of disc reflection, broadened iron lines and signatures of disc winds. We also briefly describe our models' interpretation of microquasar state transitions. We highlight our result that the most radio-loud and most radio-quiet objects both harbour highly spinning black holes but in retrograde and prograde configurations, respectively.

AB  - We use new mid-infrared (mid-IR) photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope to study the relations between low-frequency radio luminosity density ?, mid-IR (12 mum rest frame) luminosity ? and optical emission-line ([O II]) luminosity L]O II], for a complete sample of z˜ 1 radio galaxies from the 3CRR, 6CE, 6C*, 7CRS and TOOT00 surveys. The narrow redshift span of our sample (0.9 < z < 1.1) means that it is unbiased to evolutionary effects. We find evidence that these three quantities are positively correlated. The scaling between ? and L[O II] is similar to that seen in other active galactic nuclei samples, consistent with both ? and L[O II] tracing accretion rate. We show that the positive correlation between ? and ? implies that there is a genuine lack of objects with low values of ? at high values of ?. Given that ? traces accretion rate, while ? traces jet power, this can be understood in terms of a minimum accretion rate being necessary to produce a given jet power. This implies that there is a maximum efficiency with which accreted energy can be chanelled into jet power and this efficiency is of the order of unity.

AB  - In this note, we explore a pathway to radio-loudness under the hypothesis that retrograde accretion onto giant (MBH˜109 Msun) rapidly spinning (a>=0.7) black holes (BHs) leads to the launch of powerful jets, as seen in radio-loud QSOs and recently in LAT/Fermi and BAT/Swift Blazars.  Counter-rotation of the accretion disc relative to the BH spin is here associated to gas-poor galaxy mergers progenitors of giant (missing-light) ellipticals.  The occurrence of retrograde accretion enters as unifying element that may account for the radio-loudness/galaxy morphology dichotomy observed in AGN.

AB  - Using Chandra X-ray and Very Large Array radio data, we investigate the scaling relationship between jet power, P jet, and synchrotron luminosity, P radio. We expand the sample presented in Bîrzan et al. to lower radio power by incorporating measurements for 21 giant elliptical galaxies (gEs) to determine if the Bîrzan et al. P jet-P radio scaling relations are continuous in form and scatter from gEs up to brightest cluster galaxies. We find a mean scaling relation of P jet ≈ 5.8 × 1043(P radio/1040)0.70 erg s-1 which is continuous over ~6-8 decades in P jet and P radio with a scatter of ≈ 0.7 dex. Our mean scaling relationship is consistent with the model presented in Willott et al. if the typical fraction of lobe energy in non-radiating particles to that in relativistic electrons is gsim100. We identify several gEs whose radio luminosities are unusually large for their jet powers and have radio sources which extend well beyond the densest parts of their X-ray halos. We suggest that these radio sources are unusually luminous because they were unable to entrain appreciable amounts of gas.

AB  - Aims: We study the correlations between the VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array) radio emission at 15 GHz, extended emission at 151 MHz, and optical nuclear emission at 5100 Å for a complete sample of 135 compact jets.  Methods: We use the partial Kendall's tau correlation analysis to check the link between radio properties of parsec-scale jets and optical nuclear luminosities of host active galactic nuclei (AGN).  Results: We find a significant positive correlation for 99 quasars between optical nuclear luminosities and total radio (VLBA) luminosities of unresolved cores at 15 GHz originated at milliarcseconds scales. For 18 BL Lacs, the optical continuum emission correlates with the radio emission of the jet at 15 GHz. We suggest that the radio and optical emission are beamed and originate in the innermost part of the sub-parsec-scale jet in quasars. Analysis of the relation between the apparent speed of the jet and the optical nuclear luminosity at 5100 Å supports the relativistic beaming model for the optical emission generated in the jet, and allows the peak values of the intrinsic optical luminosity of the jet and its Lorentz factor to be estimated for the populations of quasars (2×1020 W Hz-1 and gamma = 52), BL Lacs (9×1021 W Hz-1 and gamma = 20), and radio galaxies (1.5×1021 W Hz-1 and gamma = 9). The radio-loudness of quasars (the ratio of 15 GHz flux density and optical nuclear flux at 5100 Å) is found to increase at high redshifts, which is interpreted as progressively higher Doppler factors in radio regime compared to those in optical. A strong positive correlation is found between the intrinsic kinetic power of the jet (measured from the flux density at 151 MHz) and the apparent luminosities of the total and the unresolved core emission of the jet at 15 GHz. This correlation is interpreted in terms of an intrinsically more luminous parsec-scale jet producing more luminous extended structure, which is detectable at low radio frequencies, 151 MHz. A possibility that the low frequency radio emission is relativistically beamed in superluminal sources and therefore correlates with radio luminosity of the jet at 15 GHz cannot be ruled out. Monitoring of superluminal AGN in a wide range of frequencies is required to check the contribution of each effect.

AB  - B2352+495 is a prototypical example of a compact symmetric object. It has a double radio lobe symmetrically located with respect to a central flat-spectrum radio core (the location of the active galactic nucleus) and has a physical extent of less than 200 pc. In this work, we report Very Long Baseline Array observation of 21 cm H I absorption toward B2352+495 to investigate the properties of this remarkable radio source, in particular, to explore whether the radio emission can be confined by circumnuclear material (frustration scenario) or whether the source is likely to be young. We confirmed the two H I absorption features previously detected toward B2352+495---a broad line nearly centered at the systemic velocity of the galaxy and a narrow redshifted component. The atomic gas from the broad absorption component is likely associated with circumnuclear material, consistent with the current paradigm of clumpy H I distribution in toroidal structures around supermassive black holes.

The observations of 85 galaxies extracted from the 2 Jy IRAS-NVSS sample in the right ascension (B1950) range 20h-00h are reported in this paper. We detected the H I 21 cm line in 82 of these galaxies, with 18 being new detections, and the OH 18 cm lines in seven galaxies, with four being new detections. In some cases, the H I spectra show the classic double-horned or single-peaked emission profiles. However, the majority exhibit distorted H I spectral features indicating that the galaxies are in interacting and/or merging systems. From these H I and OH observations, various properties of the sample are derived and reported.

AB  - We present Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) and Arecibo observations of two lensed submillimeter galaxies at z ~ 2.5, in order to search for redshifted 22.235 GHz water megamaser emission. Both SMM J14011+0252 and SMM J16359+6612 have multi-wavelength characteristics consistent with ongoing starburst activity, as well as CO line emission indicating the presence of warm molecular gas. Our observations do not reveal any evidence for H2O megamaser emission in either target, while the lensing allows us to obtain deep limits to the H2O line luminosities, L_H_2O < 7470 L_&sun; (3sigma) in the case of SMM J14011+0252, and L_H_2O < 1893 L_&sun; for SMM J16359+6612, assuming line widths of 80 km s-1. Our search for, and subsequent nondetection of, H2O megamaser emission in two strongly lensed starburst galaxies rich in gas and dust suggests that such megamaser emission is not likely to be common within the unlensed population of high-redshift starburst galaxies. We use the recent detection of strong H2O megamaser emission in the lensed quasar, MG J0414+0534 at z = 2.64 to make predictions for future EVLA C-band surveys of H2O megamaser emission in submillimeter galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei.

AB  - Luminous extragalactic water masers are known to be associated with active galactic nuclei and have provided accurate estimates for the mass of the central supermassive black hole and the size and structure of the circumnuclear accretion disc in nearby galaxies. To find water maser systems at much higher redshifts, we have begun a survey of known gravitationally lensed quasars and star-forming galaxies. In this paper, we present a search for 22 GHz (rest-frame) water masers towards five dusty, gravitationally lensed quasars and star-forming galaxies at redshifts between 2.3 and 2.9 with the Effelsberg radio telescope and the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA). Our observations do not find any new definite examples of high-redshift water maser galaxies, suggesting that large reservoirs of dust and gas are not a sufficient condition for powerful water maser emission. However, we do find the tentative detection of a water maser system in the active galaxy IRAS 10214+4724 at redshift 2.285. Our survey has now doubled the number of gravitationally lensed galaxies and quasars that have been searched for high-redshift water maser emission. We also present an updated analysis of the high-redshift water maser luminosity function that is based on the results presented here and from the only cosmologically distant (z > 1) water maser galaxy found thus far, MG J0414+0534 at redshift 2.64. By comparing with the water maser luminosity function locally and at moderate redshifts, we find that there must be some evolution in the luminosity function of water maser galaxies at high redshifts. By assuming a moderate evolution [(1 +z)4] in the water maser luminosity function, we find that blind surveys for water maser galaxies are only worthwhile with extremely high sensitivity like that of the planned Square Kilometre Array (Phase 2), which is scheduled to be completed by 2020. However, instruments like the EVLA and MeerKAT will be capable of detecting water maser systems similar to the one found from MG J0414+0534 through dedicated pointed observations, providing suitable high-redshift targets can be selected.

AB  - OH maser emission at 1.67 GHz is known to be associated with regions of intense star formation within ULIRGs. As these galaxies are formed through violent mergers, studying the co-moving density of OH maser galaxies across cosmic time will allow the merger rate of the Universe to be determined in an independent way. This merger rate is an important parameter in galaxy formation and evolution scenarios. The sensitivity, wide field of view and spectral coverage of both APERTIF on the WSRT and ASKAP will allow for the first time all-sky blind surveys for OH maser galaxies to be carried out to redshift 1.4. We describe the prospects for such surveys, including the expected number of OH maser galaxies that will be discovered, and what limits can be placed on the OH maser luminosity function, and hence the merger rate out to redshift 1.4 with various survey strategies.

AB  - We analyze the morphological properties of a large sample of 1503 70 mum selected galaxies in the COSMOS field spanning the redshift range 0.01 < z < 3.5 with a median redshift of 0.5 and an infrared luminosity range of 108 < L IR(8 - 1000 mum)< 1014 L sun with a median luminosity of 1011.4 L sun. In general, these galaxies are massive, with a stellar mass range of 1010-1012 M sun, and luminous, with -25 < M K < -20. We find a strong correlation between the fraction of major mergers and L IR, with the fraction at the highest luminosity (L IR > 1012 L sun) being up to ~50%. We also find that the fraction of spirals drops dramatically with L IR. Minor mergers likely play a role in boosting the infrared luminosity for sources with low luminosities (L IR < 1011.5 L sun). The precise fraction of mergers in any given L IR bin varies by redshift due to sources at z > 1 being difficult to classify and subject to the effects of bandpass shifting; therefore, these numbers can only be considered lower limits. At z < 1, where the morphological classifications are most robust, major mergers clearly dominate the ULIRG population (~50%-80%) and are important for the LIRG population (~25%-40%). At z > 1, the fraction of major mergers is lower, but is at least 30%-40% for ULIRGs. In a comparison of our visual classifications with several automated classification techniques we find general agreement; however, the fraction of identified mergers is underestimated due to automated classification methods being sensitive to only certain timescales of a major merger. Although the general morphological trends agree with what has been observed for local (U)LIRGs, the fraction of major mergers is slightly lower than seen locally. This is in part due to the difficulty of identifying merger signatures at high redshift. The distribution of the U - V color of the galaxies in our sample peaks in the green valley (langU - Vrang = 1.1) with a large spread at bluer and redder colors and with the major mergers peaking more strongly in the green valley than the rest of the morphological classes. We argue that, given the number of major gas-rich mergers observed and the relatively short timescale that they would be observable in the (U)LIRG phase, it is plausible for the observed red sequence of massive ellipticals (<1012 M sun) to have been formed entirely by gas-rich major mergers.

AB  - We present Spitzer 7-38 mum spectra for a 24 mum flux-limited sample of galaxies at z ~ 0.7 in the COSMOS field. The detailed high-quality spectra allow us to cleanly separate star formation (SF) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) in individual galaxies. We first decompose mid-infrared luminosity functions (LFs). We find that the SF 8 mum and 15 mum LFs are well described by Schechter functions. AGNs dominate the space density at high luminosities, which leads to the shallow bright-end slope of the overall mid-infrared LFs. The total infrared (8-1000 mum) LF from 70 mum selected galaxies shows a shallower bright-end slope than the bolometrically corrected SF 15 mum LF, owing to the intrinsic dispersion in the mid-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions. We then study the contemporary growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes (BHs). Seven of the thirty-one luminous infrared galaxies with Spitzer spectra host luminous AGNs, implying an AGN duty cycle of 23% $\pm$ 9%. The time-averaged ratio of BH accretion rate and SF rate matches the local M BH - M bulge relation and the M BH - M host relation at z ~ 1. These results favor co-evolution scenarios in which BH growth and intense SF happen in the same event but the former spans a shorter lifetime than the latter. Finally, we compare our mid-infrared spectroscopic selection with other AGN identification methods and discuss candidate Compton-thick AGNs in the sample. While only half of the mid-infrared spectroscopically selected AGNs are detected in X-ray, ~90% of them can be identified with their near-infrared spectral indices.

AB  - We report a search for H2O megamasers in 274 SDSS type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs; 0.3 <z< 0.83), half of which can be classified as type-2 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) from their [O III] 5007 luminosity, using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and the Effelsberg 100 m radio telescope. Apart from the detection of the extremely luminous water vapor megamaser SDSS J080430.99+360718.1, already reported by Barvainis & Antonucci, we do not find any additional line emission. This high rate of nondetections is compared to the water maser luminosity function created from the 78 water maser galaxies known to date and its extrapolation toward the higher luminosities of ``gigamasers'' that we would have been able to detect given the sensitivity of our survey. The properties of the known water masers are summarized and discussed with respect to the nature of high-z type-2 AGNs and megamasers in general. In the Appendix, we list 173 additional objects (mainly radio galaxies, but also QSOs and galaxies) that were observed with the GBT, the Effelsberg 100 m radio telescope, or Arecibo Observatory without leading to the detection of water maser emission.

AB  - Fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is an almost universally used technique that has matured significantly in the last decade. Model predictions and fitting procedures have improved significantly over this time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of available data. We review here the field of SED fitting, describing the modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy SEDs, the creation of multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to fit model SEDs to observed galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major ingredients of SED fitting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models, and the best fitting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that SED fitting can be used effectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies, such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in a galaxy, finer details of dust properties and dust-star geometry, and the influences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties. The present review will be made available on an interactive, moderated web page (http://sedfitting.org), where the community can access and change the text. The intention is to expand the text and keep it up to date over the coming years.

AB  - In this series of four lectures, I discuss four important aspects of AGN host galaxies. In Lecture #1, I address the starburst-AGN connection. First, I briefly review the primary diagnostic tools that are used to quantify and distinguish star formation and nuclear activity. Next I describe the best evidence for a connection between these two processes, first at low luminosity and then at high luminosity. In the last section, I summarize the main results and offer possible explanations. In Lecture #2, I discuss our current understanding of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (log[LIR/L&sun; => 12; ULIRGs). First, I describe the general properties of ULIRGs, comparing the local sample with their distant counterparts. Then I discuss the role of ULIRGs in the formation and evolution of spheroids and their massive black holes. The discussion of their possible role in the metal enrichment of the IGM through superwinds is postponed until Lecture #3. In this third lecture, I discuss the importance of feedback processes in the local and distant universe. The emphasis is on mechanical feedback. I describe the basic physics of winds, a few classic examples of winds in the local universe, the statistical properties of winds, near and far, and their impact on galaxy formation and evolution. A list of potential thesis projects is given at the end. The fourth and final lecture is on elemental abundances as tracers of star formation. First, I explain the basic principles behind chemical evolution, and describe three simple models whose predictions are compared with observations in the Milky Way. Next I discuss and give an interpretation of the results of abundance determinations in local quiescent and starburst galaxies before discussing elemental abundances in the more distant universe.

AB  - This article describes the assembly of an optical (RGB) all-sky mosaic image with an image scale of 36pixel, a limiting magnitude of approximately 14 mag, and an 18 bit dynamic range. Using a portable low-cost CCD camera system, 70 fields (each covering 40$\,^\circ$×27$\,^\circ$) were imaged over a time span of 22 months from dark-sky locations in South Africa, Texas, and Michigan. The fields were photometrically calibrated against standard catalog stars. Using sky background data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes, gradients resulting from artificial light pollution, airglow, and zodiacal light were eliminated, while the large-scale galactic and extragalactic background resulting from unresolved sources was preserved. The 648 megapixel image is a valuable educational tool, being able to fully utilize the resolution and dynamic range of modern full-dome planetarium projection systems.

AB  - Galaxies had their most significant impact on the Universe when they assembled their first generations of stars. Energetic photons emitted by young, massive stars in primeval galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium surrounding their host galaxies, cleared sightlines along which the light of the young galaxies could escape, and fundamentally altered the physical state of the intergalactic gas in the Universe continuously until the present day. Observations of the cosmic microwave background, and of galaxies and quasars at the highest redshifts, suggest that the Universe was reionized through a complex process that was completed about a billion years after the Big Bang, by redshift z~6. Detecting ionizing Lyman-alpha photons from increasingly distant galaxies places important constraints on the timing, location and nature of the sources responsible for reionization. Here we report the detection of Lyalpha photons emitted less than 600million years after the Big Bang. UDFy-38135539 (ref. 5) is at a redshift of z = 8.5549+/-0.0002, which is greater than those of the previously known most distant objects, at z = 8.2 (refs 6 and 7) and z = 6.96 (ref. 8). We find that this single source is unlikely to provide enough photons to ionize the volume necessary for the emission line to escape, requiring a significant contribution from other, probably fainter galaxies nearby.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss two approximate methods previously suggested for modeling hyperfine spectral line emission for molecules whose collisional transition rates between hyperfine levels are unknown. Hyperfine structure is seen in the rotational spectra of many commonly observed molecules such as HCN, HNC, NH3, N2H+, and C17O. The intensities of these spectral lines can be modeled by numerical techniques such as Lambda-iteration that alternately solve the equations of statistical equilibrium and the equation of radiative transfer. However, these calculations require knowledge of both the radiative and collisional rates for all transitions. For most commonly observed radio frequency spectral lines, only the net collisional rates between rotational levels are known. For such cases, two approximate methods have been suggested. The first method, hyperfine statistical equilibrium, distributes the hyperfine level populations according to their statistical weight, but allows the population of the rotational states to depart from local thermal equilibrium (LTE). The second method, the proportional method, approximates the collision rates between the hyperfine levels as fractions of the net rotational rates apportioned according to the statistical degeneracy of the final hyperfine levels. The second method is able to model non-LTE hyperfine emission. We compare simulations of N2H+ hyperfine lines made with approximate and more exact rates and find that satisfactory results are obtained.

AB  - We are developing automated systems to provide homogeneous calibration meta-data for heterogeneous imaging data, using the pixel content of the image alone where necessary. Standardized and complete calibration meta-data permit generative modeling: A good model of the sky through wavelength and time-that is, a model of the positions, motions, spectra, and variability of all stellar sources, plus an intensity map of all cosmological sources-could synthesize or generate any astronomical image ever taken at any time with any equipment in any configuration. We argue that the best-fit or highest likelihood model of the data is also the best possible astronomical catalog constructed from those data. A generative model or catalog of this form is the best possible platform for automated discovery, because it is capable of identifying informative failures of the model in new data at the pixel level, or as statistical anomalies in the joint distribution of residuals from many images. It is also, in some sense, an astronomer's ``theory of everything.''

AB  - Considerable progress has been made in determining the Hubble constant over the past two decades. We discuss the cosmological context and importance of an accurate measurement of the Hubble constant, focusing on six high-precision distance-determination methods: Cepheids, tip of the red giant branch, maser galaxies, surface brightness fluctuations, the Tully-Fisher relation, and Type Ia supernovae. We discuss in detail known systematic errors in the measurement of galaxy distances and how to minimize them. Our best current estimate of the Hubble constant is 73$\pm$2 (random) $\pm$ 4 (systematic) km s-1 Mpc-1. The importance of improved accuracy in the Hubble constant will increase over the next decade with new missions and experiments designed to increase the precision in other cosmological parameters. We outline the steps that will be required to deliver a value of the Hubble constant to 2% systematic uncertainty and discuss the constraints on other cosmological parameters that will then be possible with such accuracy.

AB  - Positronium is a short-lived atom consisting of a bound electron-positron pair. In the triplet state, when the spins of both particles are parallel, radiative recombination lines will be emitted prior to annihilation. The existence of celestial positronium is revealed through gamma-ray observations of its annihilation products. These observations, however, have intrinsically low angular resolution. In this paper, we examine the prospects for detecting the positronium recombination spectrum. Such observations have the potential to reveal discrete sources of e + for the first time and will allow the acuity of optical telescopes and instrumentation to be applied to observations of high-energy phenomena. We review the theory of the positronium recombination spectrum and provide formulae to calculate expected line strengths from the e + production rate and for different conditions in the interstellar medium. We estimate the positronium emission line strengths for several classes of Galactic and extragalactic sources. These are compared to current observational limits and to current and future sensitivities of optical and infrared instrumentation. We find that observations of the Psalpha line should soon be possible due to recent advances in NIR spectroscopy.

AB  - This paper focuses on cosmological constraints derived from analysis of WMAP data alone. A simple LambdaCDM cosmological model fits the five-year WMAP temperature and polarization data. The basic parameters of the model are consistent with the three-year data and now better constrained: Omega b  h 2 = 0.02273 $\pm$ 0.00062, Omega c  h 2 = 0.1099 $\pm$ 0.0062, OmegaLambda = 0.742 $\pm$ 0.030, ns = 0.963+0.014 -0.015, tau = 0.087 $\pm$ 0.017, and sigma8 = 0.796 $\pm$ 0.036, with h = 0.719+0.026 -0.027. With five years of polarization data, we have measured the optical depth to reionization, tau>0, at 5sigma significance. The redshift of an instantaneous reionization is constrained to be z reion = 11.0 $\pm$ 1.4 with 68% confidence. The 2sigma lower limit is z reion > 8.2, and the 3sigma limit is z reion > 6.7. This excludes a sudden reionization of the universe at z = 6 at more than 3.5sigma significance, suggesting that reionization was an extended process. Using two methods for polarized foreground cleaning we get consistent estimates for the optical depth, indicating an error due to the foreground treatment of tau ~ 0.01. This cosmological model also fits small-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, and a range of astronomical data measuring the expansion rate and clustering of matter in the universe. We find evidence for the first time in the CMB power spectrum for a nonzero cosmic neutrino background, or a background of relativistic species, with the standard three light neutrino species preferred over the best-fit LambdaCDM model with N eff = 0 at >99.5% confidence, and N eff > 2.3(95%confidence limit (CL)) when varied. The five-year WMAP data improve the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r < 0.43(95%CL), for power-law models, and halve the limit on r for models with a running index, r < 0.58(95%CL). With longer integration we find no evidence for a running spectral index, with dns /dln k = -0.037 $\pm$ 0.028, and find improved limits on isocurvature fluctuations. The current WMAP-only limit on the sum of the neutrino masses is ∑m nu < 1.3 eV(95%CL), which is robust, to within 10%, to a varying tensor amplitude, running spectral index, or dark energy equation of state.  WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.

AB  - We describe a data reduction pipeline for very long baseline interferometry astrometric observations of pulsars, implemented using the ParselTongue AIPS interface. The pipeline performs calibration (including ionosphere modeling), phase referencing with proper accounting for the reference source structure, amplitude corrections for pulsar scintillation, and position fitting to yield the position, proper motion, and parallax. The optimal data weighting scheme to minimize the total error budget of a parallax fit, and how this scheme varies with pulsar parameters such as flux density, is also investigated. The robustness of the techniques employed is demonstrated with the presentation of the first results from a two-year astrometry program using the Australian Long Baseline Array. The parallax of PSR J1559-4438 is determined to be 1pi = 0.384 $\pm$ 0.081 mas (1sigma), resulting in a distance estimate of 2600 pc that is consistent with earlier dispersion measure and HI absorption stimates.

AB  - Using the recently upgraded Long Baseline Array, we have measured the trigonometric parallax of PSR J0437-4715 to better than 1% precision, the most precise pulsar distance determination made to date. Comparing this VLBI distance measurement to the kinematic distance obtained from pulsar timing, which is calculated from the pulsar's proper motion and apparent rate of change of orbital period, gives a precise limit on the unmodeled relative acceleration between the solar system and PSR J0437-4715, which can be used in a variety of applications. First, it shows that Newton's gravitational constant G is stable with time (G/G=(-5+/-26)×10-13 yr-1, 95% confidence). Second, if a stochastic gravitational wave background existed at the currently quoted limit, this null result would fail ~50% of the time. Third, it excludes Jupiter-mass planets within 226 AU of the Sun in 50% of the sky (95% confidence). Finally, the ~1% agreement of the parallax and orbital period derivative distances provides a fundamental confirmation of the parallax distance method on which all astronomical distances are based.

AB  - The survey description and the near-, mid-, and far-infrared flux properties are presented for the 258 galaxies in the Local Volume Legacy (LVL). LVL is a Spitzer Space Telescope legacy program that surveys the local universe out to 11 Mpc, built upon a foundation of ultraviolet, Halpha, and Hubble Space Telescope imaging from 11HUGS (11 Mpc Halpha and Ultraviolet Galaxy Survey) and ANGST (ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury). LVL covers an unbiased, representative, and statistically robust sample of nearby star-forming galaxies, exploiting the highest extragalactic spatial resolution achievable with Spitzer. As a result of its approximately volume-limited nature, LVL augments previous Spitzer observations of present-day galaxies with improved sampling of the low-luminosity galaxy population. The collection of LVL galaxies shows a large spread in mid-infrared colors, likely due to the conspicuous deficiency of 8 mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission from low-metallicity, low-luminosity galaxies. Conversely, the far-infrared emission tightly tracks the total infrared emission, with a dispersion in their flux ratio of only 0.1 dex. In terms of the relation between the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and the ultraviolet spectral slope, the LVL sample shows redder colors and/or lower infrared-to-ultraviolet ratios than starburst galaxies, suggesting that reprocessing by dust is less important in the lower mass systems that dominate the LVL sample. Comparisons with theoretical models suggest that the amplitude of deviations from the relation found for starburst galaxies correlates with the age of the stellar populations that dominate the ultraviolet/optical luminosities.

AB  - Temporal explanations to the Fermi paradox state that the vast scale of the galaxy diminishes the chances of establishing contact with an extraterrestrial technological civilization (ETC) within a certain time window. This argument is tackled in this work in the context of exploration probes, whose propagation can be faster than that of a colonization wavefront. Extensive computational simulations have been done to build a numerical model of the dynamics of the exploration. A probabilistic analysis is subsequently conducted in order to obtain bounds on the number of ETCs that may be exploring the galaxy without establishing contact with Earth, depending on factors such as the number of probes they use, their lifetime and whether they leave some long-term imprint on explored systems or not. The results indicate that it is unlikely that more than ~102-103 ETCs are exploring the galaxy in a given Myr, if their probes have a lifetime of 50 Myr and contact evidence lasts for 1 Myr. This bound goes down to ~10 if contact evidence lasts for 100 Myr, and is also shown to be inversely proportional to the lifetime of probes. These results are interpreted in light of the Fermi paradox and are compatible with non-stationary astrobiological models in which a few ETCs have gradually appeared in the Fermi-Hart timescale.

AB  - We have detected the CO(2-1) transition from the submillimetre galaxy (SMG) LESSJ033229.4-275619 at z = 4.755 using the new Compact Array Broadband Backend system on the Australian Telescope Compact Array. These data have identified a massive gas reservoir available for star formation for the first time in an SMG at z ~ 5. We use the luminosity and velocity width (full width at half-maximum, FWHM, of ~=160kms-1) of the CO(2-1) line emission to constrain the gas and dynamical mass of Mgas ~= 1.6 × 1010Msolar and Mdyn(<2kpc) ~= 5 × 1010(0.25/sin2i)Msolar, respectively, similar to that observed for SMGs at lower redshifts of z ~ 2-4, although we note that our observed CO FWHM is a factor of ~3 narrower than typically seen in SMGs. Together with the stellar mass we estimate a total baryonic mass of Mbary ~= 1 × 1011Msolar, consistent with the dynamical mass for this young galaxy within the uncertainties. Dynamical and baryonic mass limits of high-redshift galaxies are useful tests of galaxy formation models: using the known z ~ 4-5 SMGs as examples of massive baryonic systems, we find that their space density is consistent with that predicted by current galaxy formation models. In addition, these observations have helped to confirm that z ~ 4-5 SMGs possess the baryonic masses and gas consumption time-scales necessary to be the progenitors of the luminous old red galaxies seen at z ~ 3. Our results provide a preview of the science that ALMA will enable on the formation and evolution of the earliest massive galaxies in the Universe.

AB  - A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical construct of a star purposely shrouded by a cloak of broken-up planetary material to better utilize all of the stellar energy. A clean Dyson sphere identification would give a significant signature for intelligence at work. A search for Dyson spheres has been carried out using the 250,000 source database of the IRAS infrared satellite which covered 96% of the sky. The search has used the Calgary database for the IRAS Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) to look for fits to blackbody spectra. Searches have been conducted for both pure (fully cloaked) and partial Dyson spheres in the blackbody temperature region 100 K <= T <= 600 K. When other stellar signatures that resemble a Dyson sphere are used to eliminate sources that mimic Dyson spheres very few candidates remain and even these are ambiguous. Upper limits are presented for both pure and partial Dyson spheres. The sensitivity of the LRS was enough to find Dyson spheres with the luminosity of the Sun out to 300 pc, a reach that encompasses a million solar-type stars.

AB  - We study resolution effects in numerical simulations of gas-rich and gas-poor major mergers, and show that the formation of slowly rotating elliptical galaxies often requires a resolution that is beyond the present-day standards to be properly modelled. Our sample of equal-mass merger models encompasses various masses and spatial resolutions, ranging from about 200 pc and 105 particles per component (stars, gas and dark matter), i.e. a gas mass resolution of ~105Msolar, typical of some recently published major merger simulations, to up to 32 pc and ~103Msolar in simulations using 2.4 × 107 collisionless particles and 1.2 × 107 gas particles, among the highest resolutions reached so far for gas-rich major merger of massive disc galaxies. We find that the formation of fast-rotating early-type galaxies, that are flattened by a significant residual rotation, is overall correctly reproduced at all such resolutions. However, the formation of slow-rotating early-type galaxies, which have a low-residual angular momentum and are supported mostly by anisotropic velocity dispersions, is strongly resolution-dependent. The evacuation of angular momentum from the main stellar body is largely missed at standard resolution, and systems that should be slow rotators are then found to be fast rotators. The effect is most important for gas-rich mergers, but is also witnessed in mergers with an absent or modest gas component (0-10 per cent in mass). The effect is robust with respect to our initial conditions and interaction orbits, and originates in the physical treatment of the relaxation process during the coalescence of the galaxies. Our findings show that a high-enough resolution is required to accurately model the global properties of merger remnants and the evolution of their angular momentum. The role of gas-rich mergers of spiral galaxies in the formation of slow-rotating ellipticals may therefore have been underestimated. Moreover, the effect of gas in a galaxy merger is not limited to helping the survival/rebuilding of rotating disc components: at high resolution, gas actively participates in the relaxation process and the formation of slowly rotating stellar systems.

AB  - Numerous studies over the past 30 years have suggested there is a causal connection between the motion of the Sun through the Galaxy and terrestrial mass extinctions or climate change. Proposed mechanisms include comet impacts (via perturbation of the Oort cloud), cosmic rays and supernovae, the effects of which are modulated by the passage of the Sun through the Galactic midplane or spiral arms. Supposed periodicities in the fossil record, impact cratering dates or climate proxies over the Phanerozoic (past 545 Myr) are frequently cited as evidence in support of these hypotheses. This remains a controversial subject, with many refutations and replies having been published. Here I review both the mechanisms and the evidence for and against the relevance of astronomical phenomena to climate change and evolution. This necessarily includes a critical assessment of time series analysis techniques and hypothesis testing. Some of the studies have suffered from flaws in methodology, in particular drawing incorrect conclusions based on ruling out a null hypothesis. I conclude that there is little evidence for intrinsic periodicities in biodiversity, impact cratering or climate on timescales of tens to hundreds of Myr. Although this does not rule out the mechanisms, the numerous assumptions and uncertainties involved in the interpretation of the geological data and in particular in the astronomical mechanisms suggest that Galactic midplane and spiral arm crossings have little impact on biological or climate variation above background level. Non-periodic impacts and terrestrial mechanisms (volcanism, plate tectonics, sea level changes), possibly occurring simultaneously, remain likely causes of many environmental catastrophes. Internal dynamics of the biosphere may also play a role. In contrast, there is little evidence supporting the idea that cosmic rays have a significant influence on climate through cloud formation. It seems likely that more than one mechanism has contributed to biodiversity variations over the past half Gyr.

AB  - Using the 100-m radio telescope at Effelsberg, we mapped a large area around the Andromeda Galaxy in the 21cm line emission of neutral hydrogen to search for high-velocity clouds (HVCs) out to large projected distances in excess of 100kpc. Our 3sigma HI mass sensitivity for the warm neutral medium is 8 × 104Msolar. We can confirm the existence of a population of HVCs near M31 with typical HI masses of a few times 105Msolar. However, we did not detect any HVCs beyond a projected distance of about 50kpc from M31, suggesting that HVCs are generally found in proximity of large spiral galaxies at typical distances of a few 10kpc.  Comparison with cold dark matter (CDM)-based models and simulations suggests that only a few of the detected HVCs could be associated with primordial dark matter satellites, whereas others are most likely the result of tidal stripping. The lack of clouds beyond a projected distance of 50kpc from M31 is also in conflict with the predictions of recent CDM structure formation simulations. A possible solution to this problem could be ionization of the HVCs as a result of decreasing pressure of the ambient coronal gas at larger distances from M31. A consequence of this scenario would be the presence of hundreds of mainly ionized or pure dark matter satellites around large spiral galaxies like the Milky Way and M31.

AB  - We present new optical long-slit data along six position angles of the bulge region of M 31. We derive accurate stellar and gas kinematics reaching 5 arcmin from the center, where the disk light contribution is always less than 30%, and out to 8 arcmin along the major axis, where the disk provides 55% of the total light. We show that the velocity dispersions of McElroy (1983) are severely underestimated (by up to 50 km s-1). As a consequence, previous dynamical models have underestimated the stellar mass of M 31's bulge by a factor of 2. As a further consequence, the light-weighted velocity dispersion of the galaxy grows to 166 km s-1 and to 170 km s-1 if rotation is also taken into account, thus reducing the discrepancy between the predicted and measured mass of the black hole at the center of M 31 from a factor of 3 to a factor of 2. The kinematic position angle varies with distance, pointing to triaxiality, but a quantitative conclusion can be reached only after simultaneous proper dynamical modeling of the bulge and disk components is performed. We detect gas counterrotation near the bulge minor axis. We measure eight emission-corrected Lick indices. They are approximately constant on circles. Using simple stellar population models we derive the age, metallicity and alpha-element overabundance profiles. Except for the region in the inner arcsecs of the galaxy, the bulge of M 31 is uniformly old (>= 12 Gyr, with many best-fit ages at the model grid limit of 15 Gyr), slightly alpha-elements overabundant ([alpha/Fe] ≈ 0.2) and of solar metallicity, in agreement with studies of the resolved stellar components. The predicted u-g, g-r and r-i Sloan color profiles match the dust-corrected observations reasonably well, within the known limitations of current simple stellar population models. The stellar populations have approximately radially constant mass-to-light ratios (M/LR ≈ 4-4.5 M_&sun;/L_&sun; for a Kroupa IMF), which is in agreement with the stellar dynamical estimates based on our new velocity dispersions. In the inner arcsecs the luminosity-weighted age drops to 4-8 Gyr, while the metallicity increases to above three times the solar value. Starting from 6 arcmin from the center along the major axis, the mean age drops to <=8 Gyr with slight supersolar metallicity (≈ +0.1 dex) and alpha-element overabundance (≈ +0.2 dex) for a mass-to-light ratio M/LR <= 3 M_&sun;/L_&sun;. Diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]/Hbeta and [NI]/Hbeta emission line equivalent widths (EWs) ratios indicate that the gas is ionized by shocks outside 10 arcsec, but an AGN-like ionizing source could be present near the center. We speculate that a gas-rich minor merger happened some 100 Myr ago, causing the observed minor axis gas counterrotation, the recent star formation event and possibly some nuclear activity.

AB  - Aims: Observations acquired by the Spitzer Space Telescope and improvements to theoretical modeling of dust emission properties are used to discuss the distribution of dust and its characteristics in the closest neighbor spiral galaxy M31. These data are then used with GALEX FUV, NUV, and SDSS images to study the age dependence of the dust heating process.  Methods: Spitzer IRAC/MIPS maps of M31 were matched together and compared to dust emission models allowing us to constrain the dust mass, the intensity of the mean radiation field, the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) particles. The total infrared emission (TIR) was analyzed as a function of UV and optical colors and compared to predictions of models that consider age-dependent dust heating. Results: We demonstrate that cold-dust component emission dominates the infrared spectral energy distribution of M31. The mean intensity of the radiation field heating the dust is low (typically U < 2, where U = 1 is the value in the solar neighborhood). Because of a lack of submillimeter observations, the dust mass (M_dust) is only weakly constrained by the infrared spectrum, but we derived a lower limit of M_dust ≳ 1.1 × 107 M&sun; with a best-fit model value of M_dust = 7.6 × 107 M&sun;, in good agreement with expectations from CO and HI measurements. Across the spiral-ring structure of M31, we show that a fraction >3% of the total dust mass is in PAHs. UV and optical colors are correlated with the total infrared to far ultraviolet (TIR/FUV) ratios in ~670 pc-sized regions over the disk of M31, although deviating from the relationship between infrared excess and ultraviolet spectral slope (referred as IRX-beta relationship) for starburst galaxies. In particular, redder regions have lower values of the TIR/FUV ratio for a fixed color. Considering the predictions of models that account for the dust-heating age dependence, we found that in 83% of the regions analyzed across the 10 kpc ring, more than 50% of the energy absorbed by the dust is rediated at lambda > 4000 Å and that dust in M31 appears mainly heated by populations a few Gyr old even across the star-forming ring. We also found that the attenuation varies radially peaking close to 10 kpc and decreases more rapidly with radius in the inner regions of M31 than in the outer regions in agreement with previous studies. We finally derived the attenuation map of M31 at 6''/px resolution (~100 pc/px along the plane of M31).

AB  - We reanalyse the measurements of parallax, proper motion and line-of-sight velocity for 18 masers in high-mass star-forming regions presented by Reid et al. We use a likelihood analysis to investigate the distance of the Sun from the Galactic Centre, R0, the rotational speed of the local standard of rest, v0, and the peculiar velocity of the Sun, vsolar, for various models of the rotation curve and models which allow for a typical peculiar motion of the high-mass star-forming regions.  We find that these data are best fit by models with non-standard values for vsolar or a net peculiar motion of the high-mass star-forming regions. We argue that a correction to vsolar is much more likely and these data support the conclusion of Binney that Vsolar should be revised upwards from 5.2 to 11kms-1. We find that the values of R0 and v0 that we determine are heavily dependent on the model we use for rotation curve, with model-dependent estimates of R0 ranging from 6.7 +/- 0.5 to 8.9 +/- 0.9kpc, and those of v0 ranging from 200 +/- 20 to 279 +/- 33kms-1. We argue that these data cannot be thought of as implying any particular values of R0 or v0. However, we find that v0/R0 is better constrained, lying in the range 29.9 - 31.6kms-1kpc-1 for all models but one.

AB  - We study the dynamics of the Magellanic Clouds in a model for the Local Group whose mass is constrained using the timing argument/two-body limit of the action principle. The goal is to evaluate the role of M31 in generating the high angular momentum orbit of the Clouds, a puzzle that has only been exacerbated by the latest Hubble Space Telescope proper motion measurements. We study the effects of varying the total Local Group mass, the relative mass of the Milky Way (MW) and M31, the proper motion of M31, and the proper motion of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on this problem. Over a large part of this parameter space, we find that tides from M31 are insignificant. For a range of LMC proper motions approximately 3sigma higher than the mean and total Local Group mass >3.5 × 1012 M sun, M31 can provide a significant torque to the LMC orbit. However, if the LMC is bound to the MW, then M31 is found to have negligible effect on its motion, and the origin of the high angular momentum of the system remains a puzzle. Finally, we use the timing argument to calculate the total mass of the MW-LMC system based on the assumption that they are encountering each other for the first time, their previous perigalacticon being a Hubble time ago, obtaining M MW + M LMC = (8.7 $\pm$ 0.8) × 1011 M sun.

AB  - The M31 haunted halo is likely associated with a rich merger history, currently assumed to be caused by multiple minor mergers. Here we use the GADGET2 simulation code to test whether M31 could have experienced a major merger in its past history. Our results indicate that a (3 $\pm$ 0.5):1 gaseous-rich merger with r pericenter = 25 $\pm$ 5 kpc and a polar orbit can explain many properties of M31 and of its halo. The interaction and fusion may have begun 8.75 $\pm$ 0.35 and 5.5 $\pm$ 0.5 Gyr ago, respectively. Observed fractions of the bulge and the thin and thick disks can be retrieved for a star formation history that is almost quiescent before the fusion. This also accords well with the observed relative fractions of intermediate age and old stars in both the thick disk and the Giant Stream. In this model, the Giant Stream is caused by returning stars from a tidal tail which contains material previously stripped from the satellite prior to the fusion. These returning stars are trapped into elliptical orbits or loops for long periods of time which can reach a Hubble time, and belong to a plane that is 45$\,^\circ$ offset from the M31 disk position angle. Because these streams of stars are permanently fed by new infalling stars with high energy from the tidal tail, we predict large loops which scale rather well with the features recently discovered in the M31 outskirts. We demonstrate that a single merger could explain first-order (intensity and size), morphological, and kinematical properties of the disk, thick disk, bulge, and streams in the halo of M31, as well as the observed distribution of stellar ages, and perhaps metallicities. This challenges the current scenarios assuming that each feature in the disk (the 10 kpc ring) or in its outskirts (thick disk, the Giant Stream, and the numerous streams) is associated with an equivalent number of minor mergers. Given the large number of parameters, further constraints are certainly required to better render the complexity of M31 and of the substructures within its halo which may ultimately lead to a more precise geometry of the encounter. This would allow us, in principle, to evaluate the impact of such a major event on the Andromeda system and the Local Group.

AB  - Masers found in massive star-forming regions can be located precisely in six-dimensional phase space and therefore serve as a tool for studying Milky Way dynamics. The non-random orbital phases at which the masers are found and the sparseness of current samples require modeling. Here, we model the phase-space distribution function of 18 precisely measured Galactic masers, permitting a mean velocity offset and a general velocity dispersion tensor relative to their local standards of rest, and accounting for different pieces of prior information. With priors only on the Sun's distance from the Galactic Center and on its motion with respect to the local standard of rest, the maser data provide a weak constraint on the circular velocity at the Sun of Vc = 246 $\pm$ 30 km s-1. Including prior information on the proper motion of Sgr A* leads to Vc = 244 $\pm$ 13 km s-1. We do not confirm the value of Vc ≈ 254 km s-1 found in more restrictive models. This analysis shows that there is no conflict between recent determinations of Vc from Galactic Center analyses, orbital fitting of the GD-1 stellar stream, and the kinematics of Galactic masers; a combined estimate is Vc = 236 $\pm$ 11 km s-1. Apart from the dynamical parameters, we find that masers tend to occur at post-apocenter, circular-velocity-lagging phases of their orbits.

Special attention is given to three issues - the limitations on the applicability of the classic solutions of Goldreich, Keeley, & Kwan (1973), inferring the strength of the magnetic field from the circular polarization when the Zeeman splitting is much less than the spectral linebreadth (especially for SiO masers), and the significance of the absence of components of the Zeeman triplet in the spectra of OH masers in regions of star formation.

AB  - We report the first detection of the Zeeman effect in the 36 GHz Class I CH3OH maser line. The observations were carried out with 13 antennas of the EVLA toward the high mass star-forming region M8E. Based on our adopted Zeeman splitting factor of z = 1.7 Hz mG-1, we detect a line-of-sight magnetic field of -31.3 $\pm$ 3.5 mG and 20.2 $\pm$ 3.5 mG to the northwest and southeast of the maser line peak, respectively. This change in sign over a 1300 AU size scale may indicate that the masers are tracing two regions with different fields, or that the same field curves across the regions where the masers are being excited. The detected fields are not significantly different from the magnetic fields detected in the 6.7 GHz Class II CH3OH maser line, indicating that CH3OH masers may trace the large-scale magnetic field, or that the magnetic field remains unchanged during the early evolution of star-forming regions. Given what is known about the densities at which 36 GHz CH3OH masers are excited, we find that the magnetic field is dynamically significant in the star-forming region.

AB  - While gravitation sustains the on-going evolution of the cosmos, it is magnetism that breaks gravity's symmetry and that provides the pathway to the non-thermal Universe. By enabling processes such as anisotropic pressure support, particle acceleration, and jet collimation, magnetism has for billions of years regulated the feedback vital for returning matter to the interstellar and intergalactic medium. After reviewing recent results that demonstrate the unique view of magnetic fields provided by radio astronomy, I explain how the Square Kilometre Array will provide data that will reveal what cosmic magnets look like, how they formed, and what role they have played in the evolving Universe.

AB  - The strength of the total magnetic field in our Milky Way from radio Zeeman and synchrotron measurements is about 6 muG near the Sun and several mG in dense clouds, pulsar wind nebulae, and filaments near the Galactic Center. Diffuse polarized radio emission and Faraday rotation of the polarized emission from pulsars and background sources show many small-scale magnetic features, but the overall field structure in our Galaxy is still under debate.-Radio synchrotron observations of nearby galaxies reveal dynamically important magnetic fields of 10-30 muG total strength in the spiral arms. Fields with random orientations are concentrated in spiral arms, while ordered fields (observed in radio polarization) are strongest in interarm regions and follow the orientation of the adjacent gas spiral arms. Faraday rotation of the diffuse polarized radio emission from the disks of spiral galaxies sometimes reveals large-scale patterns which are signatures of coherent fields generated by dynamos, but in most galaxies the field structure is more complicated.-Strong magnetic fields are also observed in radio halos around edge-on galaxies, out to large distances from the plane. The synchrotron scaleheight of radio halos allows to measure the mean outflow velocity of the cosmic-ray electrons. The ordered halo fields mostly form an X-shaped pattern, but no large-scale pattern is seen in the Faraday rotation data. Diffuse polarized radio emission in the outer disks and halos is an excellent tracer of galaxy interactions and ram pressure by the intergalactic medium.-Intracluster gas can also be significantly magnetized and highly polarized due to shocks or cluster mergers.

AB  - We present the sensitivity of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array to gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by individual supermassive black hole binary systems in the early phases of coalescing at the cores of merged galaxies. Our analysis includes a detailed study of the effects of fitting a pulsar timing model to non-white timing residuals. Pulsar timing is sensitive at nanoHertz frequencies and hence complementary to Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We place a sky-averaged constraint on the merger rate of nearby (z < 0.6) black hole binaries in the early phases of coalescence with a chirp mass of 1010 Msolar of less than one merger every 7 yr. The prospects for future GW astronomy of this type with the proposed Square Kilometre Array telescope are discussed.

AB  - We look at two contrasting spin-down models for isolated radio pulsars and, accounting for selection effects, synthesize observable populations. While our goal is to reproduce all of the observable characteristics, in this paper we pay particular attention to the form of the spin period versus period derivative () diagram and its dependence on various pulsar properties. We analyse the initial spin period, the braking index, the magnetic field, various beaming models as well as the pulsar's luminosity. In addition to considering the standard magnetic dipole model for pulsar spin-down, we also consider the recent hybrid model proposed by Contopoulos and Spitkovsky. The magnetic dipole model, however, does a better job of reproducing the observed pulsar population. We conclude that random alignment angles and period-dependent luminosity distributions are essential to reproduce the observed diagram. We also consider the time decay of alignment angles and attempt to reconcile various models currently being studied. We conclude that in order to account for recent evidence for the alignment found by Weltevrede and Johnston, the braking torque on a neutron star should not depend strongly on the inclination. Our simulation code is publicly available and includes a web-based interface to examine the results and make predictions for yields of current and future surveys.

AB  - We report results from a deep high-frequency search for pulsars within the central parsec of Sgr A* using the Green Bank Telescope. The observing frequency of 15 GHz was chosen to maximize the likelihood of detecting normal pulsars (i.e., with periods of ~500 ms and spectral indices of ~-1.7) close to Sgr A* that might be used as probes of gravity in the strong-field regime; this is the highest frequency used for such pulsar searches of the Galactic center (GC) to date. No convincing candidate was detected in the survey, with a 10sigma detection threshold of ~10 muJy achieved in two separate observing sessions. This survey represents a significant improvement over previous searches for pulsars at the GC and would have detected a significant fraction (gsim5%) of the pulsars around Sgr A*, if they had properties similar to those of the known population. Using our best current knowledge of the properties of the Galactic pulsar population and the scattering material toward Sgr A*, we estimate an upper limit of 90 normal pulsars in orbit within the central parsec of Sgr A*.

AB  - Pulsars are famed for their rotational clocklike stability and their highly repeatable pulse shapes. However, it has long been known that there are unexplained deviations (often termed timing noise) from the rate at which we predict these clocks should run. We show that timing behavior often results from two different spin-down rates. Pulsars switch abruptly between these states, often quasi-periodically, leading to the observed spin-down patterns. We show that for six pulsars the timing noise is correlated with changes in the pulse shape. Many pulsar phenomena, including mode changing, nulling, intermittency, pulse-shape variability, and timing noise, are therefore linked and are caused by changes in the pulsar's magnetosphere. We consider the possibility that high-precision monitoring of pulse profiles could lead to the formation of highly stable pulsar clocks.

AB  - The goal of this article is to summarize the current state of play in the field of radio pulsar statistics. Simply put, from the observed sample of objects from a variety of surveys with different telescopes, we wish to infer the properties of the underlying sample and to connect these with other astrophysical populations (for example supernova remnants or X-ray binaries). The main problem we need to tackle is the fact that, like many areas of science, the observed populations are often heavily biased by a variety of selection effects. After a review of the main effects relevant to radio pulsars, I discuss techniques to correct for them and summarize some of the most recent results. Perhaps the main point I would like to make in this article is that current models to describe the population are far from complete and often suffer from strong covariances between input parameters. That said, there are a number of very interesting conclusions that can be made concerning the evolution of neutron stars based on current data.While the focus of this review will be on the population of isolated Galactic pulsars, I will also briefly comment on millisecond and binary pulsars as well as the pulsar content of globular clusters and the Magellanic Clouds.

AB  - High-precision pulsar timing relies on a solar system ephemeris in order to convert times of arrival (TOAs) of pulses measured at an observatory to the solar system barycenter. Any error in the conversion to the barycentric TOAs leads to a systematic variation in the observed timing residuals; specifically, an incorrect planetary mass leads to a predominantly sinusoidal variation having a period and phase associated with the planet's orbital motion about the Sun. By using an array of pulsars (PSRs J0437-4715, J1744-1134, J1857+0943, J1909-3744), the masses of the planetary systems from Mercury to Saturn have been determined. These masses are consistent with the best-known masses determined by spacecraft observations, with the mass of the Jovian system, 9.547921(2) ×10-4 M sun, being significantly more accurate than the mass determined from the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft, and consistent with but less accurate than the value from the Galileo spacecraft. While spacecraft are likely to produce the most accurate measurements for individual solar system bodies, the pulsar technique is sensitive to planetary system masses and has the potential to provide the most accurate values of these masses for some planets.

AB  - We present a merger-driven evolutionary model for the production of luminous (LIRGs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with warm infrared (IR) colours. Our results show that simulations of gas-rich major mergers including star formation, black hole growth and feedback can produce warm (U)LIRGs. We also find that while the warm evolutionary phase is associated with increased active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, star formation alone may be sufficient to produce warm IR colours. However, the transition can be suppressed entirely - even when there is a significant AGN contribution - when we assume a single-phase interstellar medium, which maximizes the attenuation. Finally, our evolutionary models are consistent with the 25-to-60 flux density ratio versus LHX/LIR relation for local LIRGs and ULIRGs, and predict the observed scatter in IR colour at fixed LHX/LIR. Therefore, our models suggest a cautionary note in the interpretation of warm IR colours: while associated with periods of active black hole growth, they are probably produced by a complex mix of star formation and AGN activity intermediate between the cold star formation dominated phase and the birth of a bright, unobscured quasar.

AB  - We present CO observations of nine ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z ~ 2 with f nu(24 mum) gsim 1 mJy, previously confirmed with the mid-IR spectra in the Spitzer First Look Survey. All targets are required to have accurate redshifts from Keck/GEMINI near-IR spectra. Using the Plateau de Bure millimeter-wave Interferometer at the Institute for Radioastronomy at Millimeter Wavelengths, we detect CO J(3-2) (seven objects) or J(2-1) (one object) line emission from eight sources with integrated intensities Ic  ~ 5sigma-9sigma. The CO-detected sources have a variety of mid-IR spectra, including strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, deep silicate absorption, and power-law continuum, implying that these molecular gas-rich objects at z ~ 2 could be either starbursts or dust-obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The measured line luminosity L'CO is (1.28-3.77) × 1010 K km/s pc2. The averaged molecular gas mass M_H_2 is 1.7 × 1010 M sun, assuming CO-to-H2 conversion factor of 0.8 M sun (K km/s pc2)-1. Three sources (33%)---MIPS506, MIPS16144, and MIPS8342---have double peak velocity profiles. The CO double peaks in MIPS506 and MIPS16144 show spatial separations of 45 kpc and 10.9 kpc, allowing the estimates of the dynamical masses of 3.2 × 1011 sin-2(i) M sun and 5.4 × 1011 sin-2(i) M sun, respectively. The implied gas fraction, M gas/M dyn, is 3% and 4%, assuming an average inclination angle. Finally, the analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope/NIC2 images, mid-IR spectra, and IR spectral energy distribution revealed that most of our sources are mergers, containing dust-obscured AGNs dominating the luminosities at (3-6) mum. Together, these results provide some evidence suggesting submillimeter galaxies, bright 24 mum, z ~ 2 ULIRGs, and QSOs could represent three different stages of a single evolutionary sequence, however, a complete physical model would require much more data, especially high spatial resolution spectroscopy.

AB  - We apply a simple model, tested on local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), to disentangle the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and starburst contributions in submillimetre and 24 mum-selected ULIRGs observed with the Spitzer-Infrared Spectrograph spectrometer. We quantitatively estimate the average AGN contribution to the stacked 6-8 mum rest-frame spectra of these sources in different luminosity and redshift ranges and, under the assumption of similar infrared-to-bolometric ratios as in local ULIRGs, the relative AGN/starburst contributions to the total infrared luminosity. Though the starburst component is always dominant in submillimetre-selected ULIRGs, we find a significant increase of the AGN contribution at redshift z > 2.3 with respect to lower z objects. Finally, we quantitatively confirm that the mid-infrared emission of 24 mum-selected ULIRGs is dominated by the AGN component, but the starburst component contributes significantly to the bolometric luminosity.

AB  - We investigate the use of mid-infrared (MIR) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bands, the continuum, and emission lines as probes of star formation (SF) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in a sample of 100 ``normal'' and local (z ~ 0.1) emission-line galaxies. The MIR spectra were obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Spectrograph as part of the Spitzer-SDSS-GALEX Spectroscopic Survey, which includes multi-wavelength photometry from the ultraviolet to the far-infrared and optical spectroscopy. The continuum and features were extracted using PAHFIT, a decomposition code which we find to yield PAH equivalent widths (EWs) up to ~30 times larger than the commonly used spline methods. Despite the lack of extreme objects in our sample (such as strong AGNs, low-metallicity galaxies, or ULIRGs), we find significant variations in PAH, continuum, and emission-line properties, and systematic trends between these MIR properties and optically derived physical properties, such as age, metallicity, and radiation field hardness. We revisit the diagnostic diagram relating PAH EWs and [Ne II]12.8 mum/[O IV]25.9 mum line ratios and find it to be in much better agreement with the standard optical SF/AGN classification than when spline decompositions are used, while also potentially revealing obscured AGNs. The luminosity of individual PAH components, of the continuum, and, with poorer statistics, of the neon emission lines and molecular hydrogen lines are found to be tightly correlated to the total infrared (TIR) luminosity, making individual MIR components good gauges of the total dust emission in SF galaxies. Like the TIR luminosity, these individual components can be used to estimate dust attenuation in the UV and in Halpha lines based on energy balance arguments. We also propose average scaling relations between these components and dust-corrected, Halpha-derived SF rates.

AB  - We present the first detections of the 3 mum water ice and 3.4 mum amorphous hydrocarbon (HAC) absorption features in z ~ 2 ULIRGs. These are based on deep rest-frame 2-8 mum Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectra of 11 sources selected for their appreciable silicate absorption. The HAC-to-silicate ratio for our z ~ 2 sources is typically higher by a factor of 2-5 than that observed in the Milky Way. This HAC ``excess'' suggests compact nuclei with steep temperature gradients as opposed to predominantly host obscuration. Beside the above molecular absorption features, we detect the 3.3 mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission feature in one of our sources with three more individual spectra showing evidence for it. Stacking analysis suggests that water ice, hydrocarbons, and PAH are likely present in the bulk of this sample even when not individually detected. The most unexpected result of our study is the lack of clear detections of the 4.67 mum CO gas absorption feature. Only three of the sources show tentative signs of this feature at significantly lower levels than has been observed in local ULIRGs. Overall we find that the closest local analogs to our sources, in terms of 3-4 mum color, HAC-to-silicate and ice-to-silicate ratios, as well as low PAH equivalent widths, are sources dominated by deeply obscured nuclei. Such sources form only a small fraction of ULIRGs locally and are commonly believed to be dominated by buried active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our sample suggests that, in an absolute number, such buried AGNs are at least an order of magnitude more common at z ~ 2 than today. The presence of PAH suggests that significant levels of star formation are present even if the obscured AGNs typically dominate the power budget.

AB  - We explore whether our models for starbursts, quiescent star-forming galaxies and for active galactic nuclei (AGN) dust tori are able to model the full range of Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra measured with Spitzer. The diagnostic plot of 9.7 mum silicate optical depth versus 6.2 mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) equivalent width, introduced by Spoon and coworkers in 2007, gives a good indication of the age and optical depth of a starburst, and of the contribution of an AGN dust torus. However, there is aliasing between age and optical depth at later times in the evolution of a starburst, and between age and the presence of an AGN dust torus. Modelling the full IRS spectra and using broad-band 25-850 mum fluxes can help to resolve these aliases. The observed spectral energy distributions require starbursts of a range of ages with initial dust optical depth ranging from 50-200, optically thin dust emission (`cirrus') illuminated by a range of surface brightnesses of the interstellar radiation field, and AGN dust tori with a range of viewing angles.

AB  - H2 pure-rotational emission lines are detected from warm (100-1500 K) molecular gas in 17/55 (31% of) radio galaxies at redshift z < 0.22 observed with the Spitzer IR Spectrograph. The summed H2 0-0 S(0)-S(3) line luminosities are L(H2) = 7 × 1038-2 × 1042 erg s-1, yielding warm H2 masses up to 2 × 1010 M sun. These radio galaxies, of both FR radio morphological types, help to firmly establish the new class of radio-selected molecular hydrogen emission galaxies (radio MOHEGs). MOHEGs have extremely large H2 to 7.7 mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission ratios: L(H2)/L(PAH7.7) = 0.04-4, up to a factor 300 greater than the median value for normal star-forming galaxies. In spite of large H2 masses, MOHEGs appear to be inefficient at forming stars, perhaps because the molecular gas is kinematically unsettled and turbulent. Low-luminosity mid-IR continuum emission together with low-ionization emission line spectra indicates low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in all but three radio MOHEGs. The AGN X-ray emission measured with Chandra is not luminous enough to power the H2 emission from MOHEGs. Nearly all radio MOHEGs belong to clusters or close pairs, including four cool-core clusters (Perseus, Hydra, A2052, and A2199). We suggest that the H2 in radio MOHEGs is delivered in galaxy collisions or cooling flows, then heated by radio-jet feedback in the form of kinetic energy dissipation by shocks or cosmic rays.

AB  - We present the results of a 5-8mum spectral analysis performed on the largest sample of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) selected so far, consisting of 164 objects up to a redshift of ~0.35. The unprecedented sensitivity of the Infrared Spectrograph onboard Spitzer allowed us to develop an effective diagnostic method to quantify the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and starburst (SB) contribution to this class of objects. The large AGN over SB brightness ratio at 5-8mum and the sharp difference between the spectral properties of AGN and SB galaxies in this wavelength range make it possible to detect even faint or obscured nuclear activity, and disentangle its emission from that of star formation. By defining a simple model we are also able to estimate the intrinsic bolometric corrections for both the AGN and SB components, and obtain the relative AGN/SB contribution to the total luminosity of each source. Our main results are the following.  (1) The AGN detection rate among local ULIRGs amounts up to 70 per cent, with 113/164 convincing detections within our sample, while the global AGN/SB power balance is ~1/3. (2) A general agreement is found with optical classification; however, among the objects with no spectral signatures of nuclear activity, our IR diagnostics find a subclass of elusive, highly obscured AGN. (3) We analyse the correlation between nuclear activity and IR luminosity, recovering the well-known trend of growing AGN significance as a function of the overall energy output of the system: the sources exclusively powered by star formation are mainly found at LIR < 1012.3 Lsolar, while the average AGN contribution rises from ~10 to ~60 per cent across the ULIRG luminosity range. (4) From a morphological point of view, we confirm that the AGN content is larger in compact systems, but the link between activity and evolutionary stage is rather loose. (5) By analysing a control sample of IR-luminous galaxies around z ~ 1, we find evidence for only minor changes with redshift of the large-scale spectral properties of the AGN and SB components. This underlines the potential of our method as a straightforward and quantitative AGN/SB diagnostic tool for ULIRG-like systems at high redshift as well, and hints to possible photometric variants for fainter sources.

AB  - We present a 5-8 mum analysis of the Spitzer spectra of 71 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with redshift z < 0.15, devoted to the study of the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and starbursts (SBs) as the power source of the extreme infrared emission. Around ~5 mum, an AGN is much brighter (by a factor of ~30) than an SB of equal bolometric luminosity. This allows us to detect the presence of even faint accretion-driven cores inside ULIRGs: signatures of AGN activity are found in ~70 per cent of our sample (50/71 sources). Through a simple analytical model, we are also able to obtain a quantitative estimate of the AGN/SB contribution to the overall energy output of each source. Although the main fraction of ULIRG luminosity is confirmed to arise from star formation events, the AGN contribution is non-negligible (~23 per cent) and is shown to increase with luminosity. The existence of a rather heterogeneous pattern in the composition and geometrical structure of the dust among ULIRGs is newly supported by the comparison between individual absorption features and continuum extinction.

AB  - We fitted Spitzer/IRS ~ 2-35 mum spectra of 26 luminous quasi-stellar objects in an attempt to define the main emission components. Our model has three major components: a clumpy torus, dusty narrow-line region (NLR) clouds, and a blackbody-like dust. The models utilize the clumpy torus of Nenkova et al. and are the first to allow its consistent check in type-I active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Single torus models and combined torus-NLR models fail to fit the spectra of most sources, but three-component models adequately fit the spectra of all sources. We present torus inclination, cloud distribution, covering factor, and torus mass for all sources and compare them with bolometric luminosity, black hole mass, and accretion rate. The torus mass is found to be correlated with the bolometric luminosity of the sources. Torus-covering factor may also be (anti-)correlated, if some possibly anomalous points are omitted. We find that a substantial amount of the ~2-7 mum radiation originates from a hot dust component, which is likely situated in the innermost part of the torus. The luminosity radiated by this component and its covering factor are comparable to those of the torus. We quantify the emission by the NLR clouds and estimate their distance from the center. The distances are ~700 times larger than the dust sublimation radius, and the NLR-covering factor is about 0.07. The total covering factor by all components is in good agreement with the known AGN type-I:type-II ratio.

AB  - We have studied the relationship between the nuclear (high-resolution) radio emission, at 8.4GHz (3.6cm) and 1.4GHz (20cm), the [OIV] lambda25.89 mum, [NeIII] lambda15.56 mum and [NeII] lambda12.81 mum emission lines and the black hole mass accretion rate for a sample of Seyfert galaxies. In order to characterize the radio contribution for the Seyfert nuclei we used the 8.4GHz/[OIV] ratio, assuming that [OIV] scales with the luminosity of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). From this we find that Seyfert 1s (i.e. Seyfert 1.0s, 1.2s and 1.5s) and Seyfert 2s (i.e. Seyfert 1.8s, 1.9s and 2.0s) have similar radio contributions, relative to the AGN. On the other hand, sources in which the [NeII] emission is dominated either by the AGN or star formation have statistically different radio contributions, with star formation dominated sources more `radio loud', by a factor of ~2.8 on average, than AGN dominated sources. We show that star formation dominated sources with relatively larger radio contribution have smaller mass accretion rates. Overall, we suggest that 8.4GHz/[OIV], or alternatively, 1.4GHz/[OIV] ratios, can be used to characterize the radio contribution, relative to the AGN, without the limitation of previous methods that rely on optical observables.

AB  - The recent Spitzer detections of the 9.7mum Si-O silicate emission in type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide support for the AGN unification scheme. The properties of the silicate dust are of key importance to understand the physical, chemical and evolutionary properties of the obscuring dusty torus around the AGN. Compared to that of the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM), the 10mum silicate emission profile of type 1 AGN is broadened and has a clear shift of peak position to longer wavelengths. In literature, this is generally interpreted as an indication of the deviations of the silicate composition, size and degree of crystallization of the AGN from that of the Galactic ISM. In this Letter, we show that the observed peak shift and profile broadening of the 9.7mum silicate emission feature can be explained in terms of porous composite dust consisting of ordinary interstellar amorphous silicate, amorphous carbon and vacuum. Porous dust is naturally expected in the dense circumnuclear region around the AGN, as a consequence of grain coagulation.

AB  - Dust reprocesses the intrinsic radiation of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to emerge at longer wavelengths. The observed mid-infrared (MIR) luminosity depends fundamentally on the luminosity of the central engine, but in detail it also depends on the geometric distribution of the surrounding dust. To quantify this relationship, we observe nearby normal AGNs in the MIR to achieve spatial resolution better than 100 pc, and we use absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity as a proxy for the intrinsic AGN emission. We find no significant difference between optically classified Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies. Spectroscopic differences, both at optical and IR wavelengths, indicate that the immediate surroundings of AGNs are not spherically symmetric, as in standard unified AGN models. A quantitative analysis of clumpy torus radiative transfer models shows that a clumpy local environment can account for this dependence on viewing geometry while producing MIR continuum emission that remains nearly isotropic, as we observe, although the material is not optically thin at these wavelengths. We find some luminosity dependence on the X-ray/MIR correlation in the smallest scale measurements, which may indicate enhanced dust emission associated with star formation, even on these sub-100 pc scales.

AB  - We present new advances in the spectral extraction of pointlike sources adapted to the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. For the first time, we created a supersampled point-spread function of the low-resolution modules. We describe how to use the point-spread function to perform optimal extraction of a single source and of multiple sources within the slit. We also examine the case of the optimal extraction of one or several sources with a complex background. The new algorithms are gathered in a plug-in called AdOpt which is part of the SMART data analysis software.

AB  - An analysis of data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory, and AKARI Infrared Astronomy Satellite is presented for the z = 0.036 merging galaxy system II Zw 096 (CGCG 448-020). Because II Zw 096 has an infrared luminosity of log(L IR/L sun) = 11.94, it is classified as a Luminous Infrared Galaxy (LIRG), and was observed as part of the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). The Spitzer data suggest that 80% of the total infrared luminosity comes from an extremely compact, red source not associated with the nuclei of the merging galaxies. The Spitzer mid-infrared spectra indicate no high-ionization lines from a buried active galactic nucleus in this source. The strong detection of the 3.3 mum and 6.2 mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission features in the AKARI and Spitzer spectra also implies that the energy source of II Zw 096 is a starburst. Based on Spitzer infrared imaging and AKARI near-infrared spectroscopy, the star formation rate is estimated to be 120 M sun yr-1 and >45 M sun yr-1, respectively. Finally, the high-resolution B-, I-, and H-band images show many star clusters in the interacting system. The colors of these clusters suggest at least two populations---one with an age of 1-5 Myr and one with an age of 20-500 Myr, reddened by 0-2 mag of visual extinction. The masses of these clusters span a range between 106 and 108 M sun. This starburst source is reminiscent of the extranuclear starburst seen in NGC 4038/9 (the Antennae Galaxies) and Arp 299 but approximately an order of magnitude more luminous than the Antennae. The source is remarkable in that the off-nuclear infrared luminosity dominates the entire system.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - We present the results of Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph low-resolution infrared 5-35 mum spectroscopy of 17 nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z < 0.2, optically classified as non-Seyferts. The presence of optically elusive, but intrinsically luminous, buried active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is investigated, based on the strengths of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission and silicate dust absorption features detected in the spectra. The signatures of luminous buried AGNs, whose intrinsic luminosities range up to ~1012 L sun, are found in eight sources. We combine these results with those of our previous research to investigate the energy function of buried AGNs in a complete sample of optically non-Seyfert ULIRGs in the local universe at z < 0.3 (85 sources). We confirm a trend that we previously discovered: that buried AGNs are more common in galaxies with higher infrared luminosities. Because optical Seyferts also show a similar trend, we argue more generally that the energetic importance of AGNs is intrinsically higher in more luminous galaxies, suggesting that the AGN-starburst connections are luminosity dependent. This may be related to the stronger AGN feedback scenario in currently more massive galaxy systems, as a possible origin of the galaxy downsizing phenomenon.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - We present the results of Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph 5-35 mum low-resolution spectroscopic energy diagnostics of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z> 0.15, classified optically as non-Seyferts. Based on the equivalent widths of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission and the optical depths of silicate dust absorption features, we searched for signatures of intrinsically luminous, but optically elusive, buried active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in these optically non-Seyfert ULIRGs. We then combined the results with those of non-Seyfert ULIRGs at z< 0.15 and non-Seyfert galaxies with infrared luminosities L IR < 1012 L sun. We found that the energetic importance of buried AGNs clearly increases with galaxy infrared luminosity, becoming suddenly discernible in ULIRGs with L IR > 1012 L sun. For ULIRGs with buried AGN signatures, a significant fraction of infrared luminosities can be accounted for by the detected buried AGN and modestly obscured (A V < 20 mag) starburst activity. The implied masses of spheroidal stellar components in galaxies for which buried AGNs become important roughly correspond to the value separating red massive and blue less-massive galaxies in the local universe. Our results may support the widely proposed AGN-feedback scenario as the origin of galaxy downsizing phenomena, where galaxies with currently larger stellar masses previously had higher AGN energetic contributions and star formation originating infrared luminosities, and have finished their major star formation more quickly, due to stronger AGN feedback.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - We report on the results of systematic infrared 2.5-5 mum spectroscopy of 45 nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z < 0.3 using AKARI IRC. This paper investigates whether the luminosities of these ULIRGs are dominated by starburst activity, or alternatively, whether optically elusive buried active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are energetically important, based on the strengths of 3.3 mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and dust absorption features at 3-4 mum. Because of the AKARI IRC's spectroscopic capability in the full 2.5-5 mum wavelength range, we can apply this energy diagnostic method to ULIRGs at z > 0.15. We estimate the intrinsic luminosities of extended (several kpc), modestly obscured (AV < 15 mag) starburst activity based on the observed 3.3 mum PAH emission luminosities measured in AKARI IRC slitless spectra, and confirm that such starbursts are energetically unimportant in nearby ULIRGs. In roughly half of the observed ULIRGs classified optically as non-Seyferts, we find signatures of luminous buried AGNs. The fraction of ULIRGs with detectable buried AGN signatures increases with increasing infrared luminosity. Our overall results support the scenario that luminous buried AGNs are important in many ULIRGs at z < 0.3 classified optically as non-Seyferts, and that the optical undetectability of such buried AGNs occurs merely because of alarge amount of nuclear dust, which can make the sightline of even the lowest dust column density opaque to the ionizing radiation of the AGNs.

AB  - We analyze a sample of galaxies chosen to have F 24 mum > 0.5 mJy and satisfy a certain IRAC color criterion. Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra yield redshifts, spectral types, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) luminosities, to which we add broadband photometry from optical through IRAC wavelengths, MIPS from 24-160 mum, 1.1 mm, and radio at 1.4 GHz. Stellar population modeling and IRS spectra together demonstrate that the double criteria used to select this sample have efficiently isolated massive star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1.9. This is the first starburst (SB)-dominated ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRG) sample at high redshift with total infrared luminosity measured directly from FIR and millimeter photometry, and as such gives us the first accurate view of broadband spectral energy distributions for SB galaxies at extremely high luminosity and at all wavelengths. Similar broadband data are assembled for three other galaxy samples---local SB galaxies, local active galactic nucleus (AGN)/ULIRGs, and a second 24 mum-luminous z ~ 2 sample dominated by AGN. L PAH/L IR for the new z ~ 2 SB sample is the highest ever seen, some three times higher than in local SBs, whereas in AGNs this ratio is depressed below the SB trend, often severely. Several pieces of evidence imply that AGNs exist in this SB-dominated sample, except two of which even host very strong AGN, while they still have very strong PAH emission. The Advanced Camera for Surveys images show that most objects have very extended morphologies in the rest-frame ultraviolet band, thus extended distribution of PAH molecules. Such an extended distribution prevents further destruction PAH molecules by central AGNs. We conclude that objects in this sample are ULIRGs powered mainly by SB; and the total infrared luminosity density contributed by this type of objects is 0.9-2.6 × 107 L sun Mpc-3.

AB  - We present new full-sky temperature and polarization maps in five frequency bands from 23 to 94 GHz, based on data from the first five years of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) sky survey. The new maps are consistent with previous maps and are more sensitive. The five-year maps incorporate several improvements in data processing made possible by the additional years of data and by a more complete analysis of the instrument calibration and in-flight beam response. We present several new tests for systematic errors in the polarization data and conclude that W-band polarization data is not yet suitable for cosmological studies, but we suggest directions for further study. We do find that Ka-band data is suitable for use; in conjunction with the additional years of data, the addition of Ka band to the previously used Q- and V-band channels significantly reduces the uncertainty in the optical depth parameter, tau. Further scientific results from the five-year data analysis are presented in six companion papers and are summarized in Section 7 of this paper. With the five-year WMAP data, we detect no convincing deviations from the minimal six-parameter LambdaCDM model: a flat universe dominated by a cosmological constant, with adiabatic and nearly scale-invariant Gaussian fluctuations. Using WMAP data combined with measurements of Type Ia supernovae and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the galaxy distribution, we find (68% CL uncertainties): Omega b  h 2 = 0.02267+0.00058 -0.00059, Omega c  h 2 = 0.1131 $\pm$ 0.0034, OmegaLambda = 0.726 $\pm$ 0.015, ns = 0.960 $\pm$ 0.013, tau = 0.084 $\pm$ 0.016, and Delta_R^2 = (2.445$\pm$ 0.096)× 10^-9 at k = 0.002 Mpc-1. From these we derive sigma8 = 0.812 $\pm$ 0.026, H 0 = 70.5 $\pm$ 1.3 km s-1 Mpc-1, Omega b  = 0.0456 $\pm$ 0.0015, Omega c  = 0.228 $\pm$ 0.013, Omega m  h 2 = 0.1358+0.0037 -0.0036, z reion = 10.9 $\pm$ 1.4, and t 0 = 13.72 $\pm$ 0.12 Gyr. The new limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is r < 0.22(95%CL), while the evidence for a running spectral index is insignificant, dns /dln k = -0.028 $\pm$ 0.020 (68% CL). We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) dark energy equation of state and the spatial curvature of the universe: -0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12(95%CL) and -0.0179 < Omega k  < 0.0081(95%CL). The number of relativistic degrees of freedom, expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is found to be N eff = 4.4 $\pm$ 1.5 (68% CL), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Models with N eff = 0 are disfavored at >99.5% confidence. Finally, new limits on physically motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are -9 < f local NL < 111 (95% CL) and -151 < f equil NL < 253 (95% CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively.  WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.

AB  - We present results on low-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) spectra of 70 IR-luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (IRS) onboard Spitzer. We selected sources from the European Large Area Infrared Survey with S15 > 0.8 mJy and photometric or spectroscopic z > 1. About half of the samples are quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) in the optical, while the remaining sources are galaxies, comprising both obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) and starbursts. Redshifts were obtained from optical spectroscopy, photometric redshifts and the IRS spectra. The later turn out to be reliable for obscured and/or star-forming sources, thus becoming an ideal complement to optical spectroscopy for redshift estimation.  We estimate monochromatic luminosities at several rest-frame wavelengths, equivalent widths and luminosities for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, and strength of the silicate feature in individual spectra. We also estimate integrated 8-1000 mum IR luminosities via spectral energy distribution fitting to MIR and far-IR (FIR) photometry from the Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic survey and the MIR spectrum. Based on these measurements, we classify the spectra using well-known IR diagnostics, as well as a new one that we propose, into three types of source: those dominated by an unobscured AGN, mostly corresponding to optical quasars (QSOs), those dominated by an obscured AGN and starburst-dominated sources. Starbursts concentrate at z ~ 0.6-1.0 favoured by the shift of the 7.7-mum PAH band into the selection 15-mum band, while AGN spread over the 0.5 < z < 3.1 range.  Star formation rates (SFR) are estimated for individual sources from the luminosity of the PAH features. An estimate of the average PAH luminosity in QSOs and obscured AGN is obtained from the composite spectrum of all sources with reliable redshifts. The estimated mean SFR in the QSOs is 50-100Msolaryr-1, but the implied FIR luminosity is 3-10 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis of the FIR photometry, suggesting destruction of the PAH carriers by energetic photons from the AGN. The SFR estimated in obscured AGN is two to three times higher than in QSOs of similar MIR luminosity. This discrepancy might not be due to luminosity effects or selection bias alone, but could instead indicate a connection between obscuration and star formation. However, the observed correlation between silicate absorption and the slope of the NIR to MIR spectrum is compatible with the obscuration of the AGN emission in these sources being produced in a dust torus.

AB  - We present an analysis of the mid-infrared emission lines for a sample of 12 low-metallicity blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies based on high-resolution observations obtained with Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. We compare our sample with a local sample of typical starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to study the ionization field of starbursts over a broad range of physical parameters and examine its difference from the one produced by the AGN. The high-ionization line [O IV]25.89 mum is detected in most of the BCDs, starbursts, and AGNs in our sample. We propose a diagnostic diagram of the line ratios [O IV]25.89 mum/[S III]33.48 mum as a function of [Ne III]15.56 mum/[Ne II]12.81 mum which can be useful in identifying the principal excitation mechanism in a galaxy. Galaxies in this diagram split naturally into two branches. Classic AGNs as well as starburst galaxies with an AGN component populate the upper branch, with stronger AGNs displaying higher [Ne III]/[Ne II] ratios. BCDs and pure starbursts are located in the lower branch. We find that overall the placement of galaxies on this diagram correlates well with their corresponding locations in the log([N II]/Halpha) versus log([O III]/Hbeta) diagnostic diagram, which has been widely used in the optical. The two diagrams provide consistent classifications of the excitation mechanism in a galaxy. On the other hand, the diagram of [Ne III]15.56 mum/[Ne II]12.81 mum versus [S IV]10.51 mum/[S III]18.71 mum is not as efficient in separating AGNs from BCDs and pure starbursts. Our analysis demonstrates that BCDs in general do display higher [Ne III]/[Ne II] and [S IV]/[S III] line ratios than starbursts, with some reaching values even higher than those found at the centers of AGNs. Despite their hard radiation field though, no [Ne V]14.32 mum emission has been detected in the BCDs of our sample.

AB  - The mid-infrared (MIR) ratio [NeIII]15.6mum/[NeII]12.8mum is a strong diagnostic of the ionization state of emission-line objects, due to its use of only strong neon emission lines only weakly affected by extinction. However, this ratio is not available to ground-based telescopes as only a few spectroscopic windows are available in the MIR. To deal with this problem, we aimed to verify if there exists a conversion law between the ground-accessible, strong MIR line ratio [SIV]/[NeII] and the diagnostic [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio that can serve as a reference for future ground-based observations. We collated the [SIV]10.5mum, [NeII]12.8mum, [NeIII]15.6mum and [SIII]18.7mum emission-line fluxes from a wide range of sources in the rich Spitzer and Infrared Space Observatory archives, and compared the [NeIII]/[NeII], [SIV]/[SIII] and [SIV]/[NeII] ratios. We find a strong correlation between the [SIV]/[NeII] and [NeIII]/[NeII] ratios, with a linear fit of log([NeIII]/[NeII]) = 0.81log([SIV]/[NeII]) + 0.36, accurate to a factor of ~2 over four orders of magnitude in the line ratios. This demonstrates clearly the ability of ground-based infrared spectrographs to do ionization studies of nebulae.

AB  - The mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 83 active galaxies, mostly Seyfert galaxies, selected from the extended 12 mum sample are presented. The data were collected using all three instruments, Infrared Array Camera (IRAC), Infrared Spectrograph (IRS), and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS), aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. The IRS data were obtained in spectral mapping mode, and the photometric data from IRAC and IRS were extracted from matched, 20'' diameter circular apertures. The MIPS data were obtained in SED mode, providing very low-resolution spectroscopy (R ~ 20) between ~55 and 90 mum in a larger, 20'' × 30'' synthetic aperture. We further present the data from a spectral decomposition of the SEDs, including equivalent widths and fluxes of key emission lines; silicate 10 mum and 18 mum emission and absorption strengths; IRAC magnitudes; and mid-far-infrared spectral indices. Finally, we examine the SEDs averaged within optical classifications of activity. We find that the infrared SEDs of Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s with hidden broad line regions (HBLRs, as revealed by spectropolarimetry or other technique) are qualitatively similar, except that Seyfert 1s show silicate emission and HBLR Seyfert 2s show silicate absorption. The infrared SEDs of other classes within the 12 mum sample, including Seyfert 1.8-1.9, non-HBLR Seyfert 2 (not yet shown to hide a type 1 nucleus), LINER, and H II galaxies, appear to be dominated by star formation, as evidenced by blue IRAC colors, strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, and strong far-infrared continuum emission, measured relative to mid-infrared continuum emission.

AB  - Context. Spitzer's wide-field surveys and followup capabilities have allowed a new breakthrough in mid-IR spectroscopy up to redshifts >= 2, especially for 24 mum detected sources.  Aims: We want to study the mid-infrared properties and the starburst and AGN contributions, of 24 mum sources at z ~ 2, through analysis of mid-infrared spectra combined with millimeter, radio, and infrared photometry. Mid-infrared spectroscopy allows us to recover accurate redshifts.  Methods: A complete sample of 16 Spitzer-selected sources (ULIRGs) believed to be starbursts at z ~ 2 (``5.8 mum-peakers'') was selected in the (0.5 deg2) J1064+56 SWIRE Lockman Hole field (``Lockman-North''). These sources have S24µ > 0.5 mJy, a stellar emission peak redshifted to 5.8 mum, and r'Vega > 23. The entire sample was observed with the low resolution units of the Spitzer/IRS infrared spectrograph. These sources have 1.2 mm observations with IRAM 30 m/MAMBO and very deep 20 cm observations from the VLA. Nine of our sources also benefit from 350 mum observation and detection from CSO/SHARC-II. All these data were jointly analyzed.  Results: The entire sample shows good quality IRS spectra dominated by strong PAH features. The main PAH features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 mum have high S/N average luminosities of 2.90$\pm$0.31, 10.38$\pm$1.09, 3.62$\pm$0.27, and 2.29$\pm$0.26×1010 L&sun;, respectively. Thanks to their PAH spectra, we derived accurate redshifts spanning from 1.750 to 2.284. The average of these redshifts is 2.017$\pm$0.038. This result confirms that the selection criteria of ``5.8 mum-peakers'' associated with a strong detection at 24 mum are reliable to select sources at z ~ 2. We have analyzed the different correlations between PAH emission and infrared, millimeter, and radio emissions. Practically all our sources are strongly dominated by starburst emission, with only one source showing an important AGN contribution. We have also defined two subsamples based on the equivalent width at 7.7 mum to investigate AGN contributions.  Conclusions: Our sample contains strong starbursts and represents a particularly 24 mum-bright class of SMGs. The very good correlation between PAH and far-IR luminosities is now confirmed in high-z starburst ULIRGs. These sources show a small AGN contribution to the mid-IR, around ~20% or less in most cases.  Colour figures and Appendices are only available in the electronic form at http://www.aanda.org

TY  - JOUR
AB  - We apply methods from Bayesian inferencing and graph theory to a data set of 102 mid-infrared spectra, and archival data from the optical to the millimeter, to construct an evolutionary paradigm for z < 0.4 infrared-luminous galaxies. We propose that the ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRG) lifecycle consists of three phases. The first phase lasts from the initial encounter until approximately coalescence. It is characterized by homogeneous mid-IR spectral shapes, and IR emission mainly from star formation, with a contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in some cases. At the end of this phase, a ULIRG enters one of two evolutionary paths depending on the dynamics of the merger, the available quantities of gas, and the masses of the black holes in the progenitors. On one branch, the contributions from the starburst and the AGN to the total IR luminosity decline and increase, respectively. The IR spectral shapes are heterogeneous, likely due to feedback from AGN-driven winds. Some objects go through a brief QSO phase at the end. On the other branch, the decline of the starburst relative to the AGN is less pronounced, and few or no objects go through a QSO phase. We show that the 11.2 mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon feature is a remarkably good diagnostic of evolutionary phase, and identify six ULIRGs that may be archetypes of key stages in this lifecycle.

AB  - We present mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectra of 16 optically faint sources with 70 mum fluxes in the range 19 mJy <f nu(70 mum) < 38 mJy. The sample spans a redshift range of 0.35 < z < 1.9, with most lying between 0.8 < z < 1.6, and has IR luminosities of 1012-1013 L sun. 10 of the 16 objects show prominent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features; four of 16 show weak PAHs and strong silicate absorption, and two objects have no discernable spectral features. Compared to samples with f nu(24 mum) > 10 mJy, the 70 mum sample has steeper IR continua and higher luminosities. The PAH-dominated sources are among the brightest starbursts seen at any redshift, and reside in a redshift range where other selection methods turn up relatively few sources. The absorbed sources are at higher redshifts and have higher luminosities than the PAH-dominated sources, and may show weaker luminosity evolution. We conclude that a 70 mum selection extending to ~20 mJy, in combination with selections at mid-IR and far-IR wavelengths, is necessary to obtain a complete picture of the evolution of IR-luminous galaxies over 0 < z < 2.

AB  - We present Spitzer measurements of the aromatic (also known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) features for 35 Seyfert galaxies from the revised Shapley-Ames sample and find that the relative strengths of the features differ significantly from those observed in star-forming galaxies. Specifically, the features at 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 mum are suppressed relative to the 11.3 mum feature in Seyferts. Furthermore, we find an anti-correlation between the L(7.7 mum)/L(11.3 mum) ratio and the strength of the rotational H2 emission, which traces shocked gas. This suggests that shocks suppress the short-wavelength features by modifying the structure of the aromatic molecules or destroying the smallest grains. Most Seyfert nuclei fall on the relationship between aromatic emission and [Ne II] emission for star-forming galaxies, indicating that aromatic-based estimates of the star formation rate are generally reasonable in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei. For the outliers from this relationship, which have small L(7.7 mum)/L(11.3 mum) ratios and strong H2 emission, the 11.3 mum feature still provides a valid measure of the star formation rate.

AB  - We have obtained mid-infrared spectra of nine cool-core galaxy clusters with the Infrared Spectrograph aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. X-ray, ultraviolet and optical observations have demonstrated that each of these clusters hosts a cooling flow which seems to be fueling vigorous star formation in the brightest cluster galaxy. Our goal is to use the advantages of the mid-infrared band to improve estimates of star formation. Our spectra are characterized by diverse morphologies ranging from classic starbursts to flat spectra with surprisingly weak dust features. Although most of our sample are known from optical/UV data to be active star-formers, they lack the expected strong mid-infrared continuum. Star formation may be proceeding in unusually dust-deficient circum-galactic environments such as the interface between the cooling flow and the relativistic jets from the active galactic nucleus.

AB  - We apply the da Cunha et al. (2008, MNRAS, 388, 1595) model of the spectral energy distribution (SEDs) of galaxies to a small pilot sample of purely star-forming ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). We interpret the observed SEDs of 16 ULIRGs using this physically-motivated model that accounts for both the emission of stellar populations from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared and for the attenuation by dust in two components: an optically-thick starburst component and the diffuse ISM. The infrared emission is computed by assuming that all the energy absorbed by dust in these components is re-radiated at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths. This model allows us to derive statistically physical properties including star formation rates, stellar masses, the temperatures and masses of different dust components, and plausible star formation histories. We find that, although the ultraviolet-to-near-infrared emission represents only a small fraction of the total power radiated by ULIRGs, observations in this wavelength range are important for understanding the properties of the stellar populations and dust attenuation in the diffuse ISM of these galaxies. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the use of mid-infrared spectroscopy from the infrared spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope is crucial to obtain realistic estimates of the extinction to the central energy source, mainly via the depth of the 9.7-mum silicate feature, and thus accurately constrain the total energy balance. Our findings are consistent with the notion that, in the local Universe, the physical properties of ULIRGs are fundamentally different from those of galaxies with lower infrared luminosities and that local ULIRGs are the result of merger-induced starbursts. While these are well-established ideas, we demonstrate the usefulness of our SED modelling in deriving relevant physical parameters that provide clues to the star formation mode of galaxies.

AB  - Spitzer spectroscopy has revealed that sime80% of submm galaxies (SMGs) are starburst (SB)-dominated in the mid-infrared. Here we focus on the remaining sime20% that show signs of harboring powerful active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We have obtained Spitzer-InfraRed Spectrograph spectroscopy of a sample of eight SMGs that are candidates for harboring powerful AGNs on the basis of IRAC color selection (S 8 mum/S 4.5 mum>2, i.e., likely power-law mid-infrared spectral energy distributions). SMGs with an AGN dominating (gsim50%) their mid-infrared emission could represent the ``missing link'' sources in an evolutionary sequence involving a major merger. First of all, we detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features in all of the SMGs, indicating redshifts from 2.5 to 3.4, demonstrating the power of the mid-infrared to determine redshifts for these optically faint dusty galaxies. Second, we see signs of both star formation (from the PAH features) and AGN activity (from continuum emission) in our sample: 62% of the sample are AGN-dominated in the mid-infrared with a median AGN content of 56%, compared with <30% on average for typical SMGs, revealing that our IRAC color selection has successfully singled out sources with proportionately more AGN emission than typical SB-dominated SMGs. However, we find that only about 10% of these AGNs dominate the bolometric emission of the SMG when the results are extrapolated to longer infrared wavelengths, implying that AGNs are not a significant power source to the SMG population overall, even when there is evidence in the mid-infrared for substantial AGN activity. When existing samples of mid-infrared AGN-dominated SMGs are considered, we find that S 8 mum/S 4.5 mum>1.65 works well at selecting mid-infrared energetically dominant AGNs in SMGs, implying a duty cycle of ~15% if all SMGs go through a subsequent mid-infrared AGN-dominated phase in the proposed evolutionary sequence.

AB  - HIZOA J0836-43 is the most H I-massive (M H I  = 7.5 × 1010 M sun) galaxy detected in the HIPASS volume (delta = -90$\,^\circ$ to + 25$\,^\circ$, v<12,700 km s-1) and lies optically hidden behind the Milky Way. Markedly different from other extreme H I disks in the local universe, it is a luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) with an actively star-forming disk (>50 kpc), central to its ~130 kpc gas disk, with a total star formation rate (SFR) of ~20.5 M sun yr-1. Spitzer spectroscopy reveals an unusual combination of powerful polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission coupled to a relatively weak warm dust continuum, suggesting photodissociation-region-dominated emission. Compared to a typical LIRG with similar total infrared luminosity (L TIR = 1011 L sun), the PAHs in HIZOA J0836-43 are more than twice as strong, whereas the warm dust continuum (lambda>20 mum) is best fit by a star-forming galaxy with L TIR = 1010 L sun. Mopra CO observations suggest an extended molecular gas component (H2 + He>3.7 × 109 M sun) and a lower limit of ~64% for the gas-mass fraction; this is above average compared to local disk systems, but similar to that of z ~ 1.5 BzK galaxies (~57%). However, the star formation efficiency (SFE = L IR/L'CO) for HIZOA J0836-43 of 140 L sun (K km s-1 pc2)-1 is similar to that of local spirals and other disk galaxies at high redshift, in strong contrast to the increased SFE seen in merging and strongly interacting systems. HIZOA J0836-43 is actively forming stars and building a massive stellar disk. Its evolutionary phase of star formation (M stellar, SFR, and gas fraction) compared to more distant systems suggests that it would be considered typical at redshift z ~ 1. This galaxy provides a rare opportunity in the nearby universe for studying (at z ~ 0.036) how disks were building and galaxies evolving at z ~ 1, when similarly large gas fractions were likely more common.

AB  - We performed an analysis of the mid-infrared properties of the 12 mum Seyfert sample, a complete unbiased 12 mum flux limited sample of local Seyfert galaxies selected from the IRAS Faint Source Catalog based on low-resolution spectra obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on-board Spitzer Space Telescope. A detailed presentation of this analysis is discussed by Wu et al. (2009). We find that, on average, the 15-30 mum slope of the continuum is < alpha15-30> = -0.85 $\pm$ 0.61 for Seyfert 1s and -1.53 $\pm$ 0.84 for Seyfert 2s, and there is substantial scatter in each type. Moreover, nearly 32% of Seyfert 1s, and 9% of Seyfert 2s, display a peak in the mid-infrared spectrum at 20 mum, which is attributed to an additional hot dust component. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) equivalent width decreases with increasing dust temperature, as indicated by the global infrared color of the host galaxies. However, no statistical difference in PAH equivalent width is detected between the two Seyfert types of the same bolometric luminosity. Finally, we propose a new method to estimate the AGN contribution to the integrated 12 mum galaxy emission, by subtracting the ``star formation'' component in the Seyfert galaxies, making use of the tight correlation between PAH 11.2 mum luminosity and 12 mum luminosity for star forming galaxies.

AB  - We present an atlas of Spitzer/IRS high-resolution (R ~ 600) 10-37 mum spectra for 24 well known starburst galaxies. The spectra are dominated by fine-structure lines, molecular hydrogen lines, and emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Six out of the eight objects with a known active galactic nucleus (AGN) component show emission of the high excitation [Ne V] line. This line is also seen in one other object (NGC 4194) with, a priori, no known AGN component. In addition to strong PAH emission features in this wavelength range (11.3, 12.7, 16.4 mum), the spectra reveal other weak hydrocarbon features at 10.6, 13.5, 14.2 mum, and a previously unreported emission feature at 10.75 mum. An unidentified absorption feature at 13.7 mum is detected in many of the starbursts. We use the fine-structure lines to derive the abundance of neon and sulfur for 14 objects where the H I 7-6 line is detected. We further use the molecular hydrogen lines to sample the properties of the warm molecular gas. Several basic diagrams characterizing the properties of the sample are also shown. We have combined the spectra of all the pure starburst objects to create a high signal-to-noise ratio template, which is available to the community.

AB  - The mid-infrared (IR) spectra of six large, irregular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with formulae (C84H24-C120H36) have been computed using density functional theory (DFT). Trends in the dominant band positions and intensities are compared to those of large, compact PAHs as a function of geometry, size, and charge. Irregular edge moieties that are common in terrestrial PAHs, such as bay regions and rings with quartet hydrogens, are shown to be uncommon in astronomical PAHs. As for all PAHs comprised solely of C and H reported to date, mid-IR emission from irregular PAHs fails to produce a strong CCstr band at 6.2 mum, the position characteristic of the important, class A astronomical PAH spectra. Earlier studies showed that inclusion of nitrogen within a PAH shifts this to 6.2 mum for PAH cations. Here we show that this band shifts to 6.3 mum in nitrogenated PAH anions, close to the position of the CC stretch in class B astronomical PAH spectra. Thus, nitrogenated PAHs may be important in all sources and the peak position of the CC stretch near 6.2 mum appears to directly reflect the PAH cation to anion ratio. Large irregular PAHs exhibit features at 7.8 mum but lack them near 8.6 mum. Hence, the 7.7 mum astronomical feature is produced by a mixture of small and large PAHs while the 8.6 mum band can only be produced by large compact PAHs. As with the CCstr, the position and profile of these bands reflect the PAH cation to anion ratio.

AB  - Aims: Molecules that trace the high-density regions of the interstellar medium may be used to evaluate the changing physical and chemical environment during the ongoing nuclear activity in (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs).  Methods: The changing ratios of the HCN (1-0), HNC (1-0), HCO+ (1-0), CN (1-0) and CN (2-1), and CS (3-2) transitions were compared with the HCN (1-0)/CO (1-0) ratio, which is proposed to represent the progression time scale of the starburst. These diagnostic diagrams were interpreted using the results of theoretical modeling with a large physical and chemical network to describe the state of the nuclear ISM in the evolving galaxies.  Results: Systematic changes are seen in the line ratios as the sources evolve from early stage for the nuclear starburst (ULIRGs) to later stages. These changes result from changing environmental conditions and particularly from the lowering of the average density of the medium. A temperature rise due to mechanical heating of the medium by feedback explains the lowering of the ratios at later evolutionary stages. Infrared pumping may affect the CN and HNC line ratios during early evolutionary stages.  Conclusions: Molecular transitions display a behavior that relates to changes of the environment during an evolving nuclear starburst. Molecular properties may be used to designate the evolutionary stage of the nuclear starburst. The HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) and HCO+(1-0)/HCN(1-0) ratios serve as indicators of the time evolution of the outburst.

AB  - The Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) combines data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, Chandra X-Ray Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) observatories, together with ground-based data, into a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of over 200 low-redshift (z < 0.088), Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs). The LIRGs are a complete subset of the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS), which comprises 629 extragalactic objects with 60 mum flux densities above 5.24 Jy, and Galactic latitudes above five degrees. The LIRGs targeted in GOALS span the full range of nuclear spectral types defined via traditional optical line-ratio diagrams (type-1 and type-2 AGN, LINERs, and starbursts) as well as interaction stages (major mergers, minor mergers, and isolated galaxies). They provide an unbiased picture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxies in the local Universe. As an example of the analytic power of the multiwavelength GOALS data set, we present Spitzer, Chandra, HST, and GALEX images and spectra for the interacting system VV 340 (IRAS F14547 + 2449). The Spitzer MIPS imaging data indicates that between 80-95% of the total far-infrared emission (or about 5 × 1011 L&sun;) originates in VV 340 north. While the Spitzer IRAC colors of VV 340 north and south are consistent with star-forming galaxies, both the Spitzer IRS and Chandra ACIS data indicate the presence of an AGN in VV 340 north. The observed line fluxes, without correction for extinction, imply that the AGN accounts for less than 10%-20% of the observed infrared emission. The X-ray data are consistent with a heavily absorbed (NH≳1024 cm-2) AGN. The GALEX far and near-UV fluxes imply a extremely large infrared ``excess'' (IRX) for the system (FIR/Ffuv ˜ 81) which is well above the correlation seen in starburst galaxies. Most of this excess is driven by VV 340 N, which has an IR excess of nearly 400. The VV 340 system seems to be comprised of two very different galaxies: an infrared luminous edge-on galaxy (VV 340 north) that dominates the long-wavelength emission from the system, which hosts a buried AGN; and a face-on starburst (VV 340 south) that dominates the short-wavelength emission.

AB  - Context. The nature of maser emission means that the apparent angular size of an individual maser spot is determined by the local amplification process as well as by the instrinsic size of the emitting cloud. Highly sensitive radio interferometry images made using MERLIN spatially and spectrally resolve water maser clouds around evolved stars.  Aims: We used measurements of the cloud properties, around the red supergiant S Per and the AGB stars IK Tau, RT Vir, U Her and U Ori, to test maser beaming theory. In particular, spherical clouds are expected to produce an inverse relationship between maser intensity and apparent size, which would not be seen from very elongated (cylindrical or slab-like) regions.  Methods: We analysed the measured properties of the maser emission in order to estimate the saturation state. We analysed the variation of observed maser spot size with intensity and across the spectral line profiles.  Results: Circumstellar masers emanate from discrete clouds from about one to 20 AU in diameter depending on the star. Most of the maser features have negative excitation temperatures close to zero and modest optical depths, showing that they are mainly unsaturated. Around S Per and (at most epochs) RT Vir and IK Tau, the maser component size shrinks with increasing intensity, although in some cases the slope is shallower than predicted, probably due to shape irregularities and the presence of velocity gradients within clouds. In contrast, the masers around U Ori and U Her tend to increase in size, with a larger scatter.  Conclusions: The water masers from S Per, RT Vir and IK Tau are mainly beamed into spots with an observed angular size much smaller than the emitting clouds. The brighter spots at the line peaks are smaller than those in the wings. This suggests that the masers are amplification-bounded, emanating from clouds which can be approximated as spheres. Many of the masers around U Her and U Ori have apparent sizes which are more similar to the emitting clouds and have less or no dependence on intensity, which suggests that these masers are matter-bounded. This is consistent with an origin in flattened clouds and these two stars have shown other behaviour indicating the presence of shocks which could produce this effect.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the polarization property of the radiation amplified by astronomical masers in the presence of a strong magnetic field. Our model explicitly takes into account the broad-band nature of the radiation field and the interaction of the radiation with the maser transition J = 1-0. The amplification of different realizations of the background continuum radiation by the maser is directly simulated and the Stokes parameters of the radiation field are then obtained by averaging over the ensemble of emerging maser radiation. For isotropic pumping and partially saturated masers, we find that the maser radiation is linearly polarized in two representative cases where the magnetic field B makes an angle theta = 30$\,^\circ$ and 90$\,^\circ$ to the maser axis. The linear polarization for maser radiation obtained in our simulations for both cases is in agreement with the results of the standard model. Furthermore, no instability during amplification is seen in our simulations. Therefore, we conclude that there is no problem with the previous numerical investigations of maser polarization in the unsaturated and partially saturated regime.

AB  - The recent measurement of the Shapiro delay in the radio pulsar PSR J1614-2230 yielded a mass of 1.97 $\pm$ 0.04 M sun, making it the most massive pulsar known to date. Its mass is high enough that, even without an accompanying measurement of the stellar radius, it has a strong impact on our understanding of nuclear matter, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and the generation of gravitational waves from coalescing neutron stars. This single high-mass value indicates that a transition to quark matter in neutron-star cores can occur at densities comparable to the nuclear saturation density only if the quarks are strongly interacting and are color superconducting. We further show that a high maximum neutron-star mass is required if short-duration GRBs are powered by coalescing neutron stars and, therefore, this mechanism becomes viable in the light of the recent measurement. Finally, we argue that the low-frequency (<=500 Hz) gravitational waves emitted during the final stages of neutron-star coalescence encode the properties of the equation of state because neutron stars consistent with this measurement cannot be centrally condensed. This will facilitate the measurement of the neutron star equation of state with Advanced LIGO/Virgo.

AB  - The Planck and Herschel missions are currently measuring the far-infrared to millimeter emission of dust, which combined with existing IR data, will for the first time provide the full spectral energy distribution (SED) of the galactic interstellar medium dust emission, from the mid-IR to the mm range, with an unprecedented sensitivity and down to spatial scales ~30''. Such a global SED will allow a systematic study of the dust evolution processes (e.g. grain growth or fragmentation) that directly affect the SED because they redistribute the dust mass among the observed grain sizes. The dust SED is also affected by variations of the radiation field intensity. Here we present a versatile numerical tool, DustEM, that predicts the emission and extinction of dust grains given their size distribution and their optical and thermal properties. In order to model dust evolution, DustEM has been designed to deal with a variety of grain types, structures and size distributions and to be able to easily include new dust physics. We use DustEM to model the dust SED and extinction in the diffuse interstellar medium at high-galactic latitude (DHGL), a natural reference SED that will allow us to study dust evolution. We present a coherent set of observations for the DHGL SED, which has been obtained by correlating the IR and HI-21 cm data. The dust components in our DHGL model are (i) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; (ii) amorphous carbon and (iii) amorphous silicates. We use amorphous carbon dust, rather than graphite, because it better explains the observed high abundances of gas-phase carbon in shocked regions of the interstellar medium. Using the DustEM model, we illustrate how, in the optically thin limit, the IRAS/Planck HFI (and likewise Spitzer/Herschel for smaller spatial scales) photometric band ratios of the dust SED can disentangle the influence of the exciting radiation field intensity and constrain the abundance of small grains (a ⪅ 10 nm) relative to the larger grains. We also discuss the contributions of the different grain populations to the IRAS, Planck (and similarly to Herschel) channels. Such information is required to enable a study of the evolution of dust as well as to systematically extract the dust thermal emission from CMB data and to analyze the emission in the Planck polarized channels. The DustEM code described in this paper is publically available.

AB  - Gravitational lensing is a powerful astrophysical and cosmological probe and is particularly valuable at submillimeter wavelengths for the study of the statistical and individual properties of dusty star-forming galaxies. However, the identification of gravitational lenses is often time-intensive, involving the sifting of large volumes of imaging or spectroscopic data to find few candidates. We used early data from the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey to demonstrate that wide-area submillimeter surveys can simply and easily detect strong gravitational lensing events, with close to 100% efficiency.

AB  - We consider the signatures of a domain wall produced in the spontaneous symmetry breaking involving a dilatonlike scalar field coupled to electromagnetism. Domains on either side of the wall exhibit slight differences in their respective values of the fine-structure constant, alpha. If such a wall is present within our Hubble volume, absorption spectra at large redshifts may or may not provide a variation in alpha relative to the terrestrial value, depending on our relative position with respect to the wall. This wall could resolve the contradiction between claims of a variation of alpha based on Keck/Hires data and of the constancy of alpha based on Very Large Telescope data. We derive the properties of the wall and the parameters of the underlying microscopic model required to reproduce the possible spatial variation of alpha. We discuss the constraints on the existence of the low-energy domain wall and describe its observational implications concerning the variation of the fundamental constants.

AB  - We introduce a probabilistic approach to the problem of counting dwarf satellites around host galaxies in databases with limited redshift information. This technique is used to investigate the occurrence of satellites with luminosities similar to the Magellanic Clouds around hosts with properties similar to the Milky Way (MW) in the object catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our analysis uses data from SDSS Data Release 7, selecting candidate MW-like hosts from the spectroscopic catalog and candidate analogs of the Magellanic Clouds from the photometric catalog. Our principal result is the probability for an MW-like galaxy to host N sat close satellites with luminosities similar to the Magellanic Clouds. We find that 81% of galaxies like the MW have no such satellites within a radius of 150 kpc, 11% have one, and only 3.5% of hosts have two. The probabilities are robust to changes in host and satellite selection criteria, background-estimation technique, and survey depth. These results demonstrate that the MW has significantly more satellites than a typical galaxy of its luminosity; this fact is useful for understanding the larger cosmological context of our home galaxy.

AB  - We present a new measurement of the mass of the Milky Way (MW) based on observed properties of its largest satellite galaxies, the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), and an assumed prior of a LambdaCDM universe. The large, high-resolution Bolshoi cosmological simulation of this universe provides a means to statistically sample the dynamical properties of bright satellite galaxies in a large population of dark matter halos. The observed properties of the MCs, including their circular velocity, distance from the center of the MW, and velocity within the MW halo, are used to evaluate the likelihood that a given halo would have each or all of these properties; the posterior probability distribution function (PDF) for any property of the MW system can thus be constructed. This method provides a constraint on the MW virial mass, 1.2+0.7 - 0.4 (stat.)+0.3 - 0.3 (sys.) × 1012 M &sun; (68% confidence), which is consistent with recent determinations that involve very different assumptions. In addition, we calculate the posterior PDF for the density profile of the MW and its satellite accretion history. Although typical satellites of 1012 M &sun; halos are accreted over a wide range of epochs over the last 10 Gyr, we find a ~72% probability that the MCs were accreted within the last Gyr, and a 50% probability that they were accreted together.

AB  - The Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope provides an unprecedented opportunity to study gamma-ray blazars. To capitalize on this opportunity, beginning in late 2007, about a year before the start of LAT science operations, we began a large-scale, fast-cadence 15 GHz radio monitoring program with the 40 m telescope at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. This program began with the 1158 northern (delta > -20$\,^\circ$) sources from the Candidate Gamma-ray Blazar Survey and now encompasses over 1500 sources, each observed twice per week with about 4 mJy (minimum) and 3% (typical) uncertainty. Here, we describe this monitoring program and our methods, and present radio light curves from the first two years (2008 and 2009). As a first application, we combine these data with a novel measure of light curve variability amplitude, the intrinsic modulation index, through a likelihood analysis to examine the variability properties of subpopulations of our sample. We demonstrate that, with high significance (6sigma), gamma-ray-loud blazars detected by the LAT during its first 11 months of operation vary with almost a factor of two greater amplitude than do the gamma-ray-quiet blazars in our sample. We also find a significant (3sigma) difference between variability amplitude in BL Lacertae objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), with the former exhibiting larger variability amplitudes. Finally, low-redshift (z < 1) FSRQs are found to vary more strongly than high-redshift FSRQs, with 3sigma significance. These findings represent an important step toward understanding why some blazars emit gamma-rays while others, with apparently similar properties, remain silent.

AB  - We used the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Spectrograph to map nearly the entire extent of Cassiopeia A between 5 and 40 mum. Using infrared and Chandra X-ray Doppler velocity measurements, along with the locations of optical ejecta beyond the forward shock, we constructed a three-dimensional model of the remnant. The structure of Cas A can be characterized into a spherical component, a tilted thick disk, and multiple ejecta jets/pistons and optical fast-moving knots all populating the thick disk plane. The Bright Ring in Cas A identifies the intersection between the thick plane/pistons and a roughly spherical reverse shock. The ejecta pistons indicate a radial velocity gradient in the explosion. Some ejecta pistons are bipolar with oppositely directed flows about the expansion center while some ejecta pistons show no such symmetry. Some ejecta pistons appear to maintain the integrity of the nuclear burning layers while others appear to have punched through the outer layers. The ejecta pistons indicate a radial velocity gradient in the explosion. In three dimensions, the Fe jet in the southeast occupies a ``hole'' in the Si-group emission and does not represent ``overturning,'' as previously thought. Although interaction with the circumstellar medium affects the detailed appearance of the remnant and may affect the visibility of the southeast Fe jet, the bulk of the symmetries and asymmetries in Cas A are intrinsic to the explosion.

AB  - We used the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Spectrograph to create a high-resolution spectral map of the central region of the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant, allowing us to make a Doppler reconstruction of its three-dimensional structure. The ejecta responsible for this emission have not yet encountered the remnant's reverse shock or the circumstellar medium, making it an ideal laboratory for exploring the dynamics of the supernova explosion itself. We observe that the O, Si, and S ejecta can form both sheet-like structures and filaments. Si and O, which come from different nucleosynthetic layers of the star, are observed to be coincident in velocity space in some regions, and separated by 500 km s-1 or more in others. Ejecta traveling toward us are, on average, ~900 km s-1 slower than the material traveling away from us. We compare our observations to recent supernova explosion models and find that no single model can simultaneously reproduce all the observed features. However, models of different supernova explosions can collectively produce the observed geometries and structures of the interior emission. We use the results from the models to address the conditions during the supernova explosion, concentrating on asymmetries in the shock structure. We also predict that the back surface of Cas A will begin brightening in ~30 years, and the front surface in ~100 years.

AB  - Theories unifying gravity with other interactions suggest spatial and temporal variation of fundamental ``constants'' in the Universe. A change in the fine structure constant,   alpha = e2/hslash c , could be detected via shifts in the frequencies of atomic transitions in quasar absorption systems. Recent studies using 140 absorption systems from the Keck telescope and 153 from the Very Large Telescope, suggest that alpha varies spatially (61). That is, in one direction on the sky alpha seems to have been smaller at the time of absorption, while in the opposite direction it seems to have been larger.

AB  - We present an analysis of the AGN broad-line regions of 6 powerful radio galaxies at z ~ 2 (HzRGs), which is part of a study of a sample of 50 HzRGs with rest-frame optical imaging spectroscopy obtained at the VLT. In 6 galaxies we detect luminous (L(Halpha) = few × 1044 erg s-1), spatially unresolved, broad (FWHM >= 10 000 km s-1) Halpha line emission from the nucleus (HalphaBLRs), consistent with broad-line regions of supermassive black holes with masses of few × 109 M&sun; and accretion luminosities of a few percent of the Eddington luminosity. In two galaxies we also detect HbetaBLRs, suggesting relatively low extinction of AV ~ 1 mag, which agrees with constraints from X-ray observations. Overall, we find HalphaBLRs in ~20% of the galaxies where Halpha is observed. By relating black hole and bulge mass, we find a possible offset towards higher black-hole masses of at most ˜0.6 dex relative to nearby galaxies at a given host mass, although each individual galaxy is within the scatter of the local relationship. If not entirely from systematic effects, this would then suggest that the masses of the host galaxies have increased by at most a factor ≈4 since z ˜ 2 2 relative to the black-hole masses, perhaps through accretion of satellite galaxies or because of a time lag between star formation in the host galaxy and AGN fueling. We also compare the radiative and mechanical energy output (from jets) of our targets with predictions of recent models of ``synthesis'' or ``grand unified'' AGN feedback, which postulate that AGN with similar radiative and mechanical energy output rates to those found in our HzRGs may be nearing the end of their period of active growth. We discuss evidence that they may reach this stage at the same time as their host galaxies.  Based on observations collected at the Very Large Telescope of ESO.

AB  - One of our closest neighbours, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) has been the subject of numerous large area studies across the entire spectrum, but so far full-disk radio surveys have been conducted only at low resolution. The new wide-field capabilities of the DiFX software correlator present the possibility of imaging the entire primary beam of a VLBI array, thus enabling a high resolution wide-field study of the entire galaxy. Using the VLBA and EVN, pilot observations of M31 have been carried out with the aim of using these new wide-field techniques to characterise the population of compact components at VLBI resolution both within and behind one of our nearest neighbours. This contribution describes the observations carried out, the preliminary processing and first results.

AB  - We explore the redshift evolution of the specific star formation rate (SSFR) for galaxies of different stellar mass by drawing on a deep 3.6 mum selected sample of >105 galaxies in the 2 deg2 COSMOS field. The average star formation rate (SFR) for subsets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission. We separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frame optical spectral energy distributions. At redshifts 0.2 < z < 3 both populations show a strong and mass-independent decrease in their SSFR toward the present epoch. It is best described by a power law (1 + z) n , where n ~ 4.3 for all galaxies and n ~ 3.5 for star-forming (SF) sources. The decrease appears to have started at z>2, at least for high-mass (M * >~ 4 × 1010 M sun) systems where our conclusions are most robust. Our data show that there is a tight correlation with power-law dependence, SSFR vprop M * beta, between SSFR and stellar mass at all epochs. The relation tends to flatten below M * ≈ 1010 M sun if quiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded from the analysis a shallow index betaSFG ≈ -0.4 fits the correlation. On average, higher mass objects always have lower SSFRs, also among SF galaxies. At z>1.5 there is tentative evidence for an upper threshold in SSFR that an average galaxy cannot exceed, possibly due to gravitationally limited molecular gas accretion. It is suggested by a flattening of the SSFR-M * relation (also for SF sources), but affects massive (>1010 M sun) galaxies only at the highest redshifts. Since z = 1.5 there thus is no direct evidence that galaxies of higher mass experience a more rapid waning of their SSFR than lower mass SF systems. In this sense, the data rule out any strong ``downsizing'' in the SSFR. We combine our results with recent measurements of the galaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass of an SF galaxy: we find that since z ~ 3 the majority of all new stars were always formed in galaxies of M * = 1010.6$\pm$0.4 M sun. In this sense, too, there is no ``downsizing.'' Finally, our analysis constitutes the most extensive SFR density determination with a single technique out to z = 3. Recent Herschel results are consistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.

AB  - We calculate the probability that a Milky-Way (MW)-like halo in the standard cosmological model has the observed number of Magellanic Clouds (MCs). The statistics of the number of MCs in the lambda cold dark matter model are in good agreement with observations of a large sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies. Under the subhalo abundance matching assumption of a relationship with small scatter between galaxy r-band luminosities and halo internal velocities v max, we make detailed comparisons to similar measurements using SDSS Data Release 7 data by Liu et al. Models and observational data give very similar probabilities for having zero, one, and two MC-like satellites. In both cases, MW luminosity hosts have just a ~10% chance of hosting two satellites similar to the MCs. In addition, we present a prediction for the probability for a host galaxy to have N sats satellite galaxies as a function of the magnitudes of both the host and satellite. This probability and its scaling with host properties is significantly different from that of mass-selected objects because of scatter in the mass-luminosity relation and because of variations in the star formation efficiency with halo mass.

AB  - I present a critical review of techniques for estimating confidence intervals on binomial population proportions inferred from success counts in small to intermediate samples. Population proportions arise frequently as quantities of interest in astronomical research; for instance, in studies aiming to constrain the bar fraction, active galactic nucleus fraction, supermassive black hole fraction, merger fraction, or red sequence fraction from counts of galaxies exhibiting distinct morphological features or stellar populations. However, two of the most widely-used techniques for estimating binomial confidence intervals - the `normal approximation' and the Clopper & Pearson approach - are liable to misrepresent the degree of statistical uncertainty present under sampling conditions routinely encountered in astronomical surveys, leading to an ineffective use of the experimental data (and, worse, an inefficient use of the resources expended in obtaining that data). Hence, I provide here an overview of the fundamentals of binomial statistics with two principal aims: (i) to reveal the ease with which (Bayesian) binomial confidence intervals with more satisfactory behaviour may be estimated from the quantiles of the beta distribution using modern mathematical software packages (e.g. r, matlab, mathematica, idl, python); and (ii) to demonstrate convincingly the major flaws of both the `normal approximation' and the Clopper & Pearson approach for error estimation.

AB  - Binaries consisting of a pulsar and a black hole (BH) are a holy grail of astrophysics, both for their significance for stellar evolution and for their potential application as probes of strong gravity. In spite of extensive surveys of our Galaxy and its system of globular clusters, no pulsar-black hole (PSR-BH) binary has been found to date. Clues as to where such systems might exist are therefore important. We show that if the central parsec around Sgr A* harbours a cluster of ˜25 000 stellar BHs (as predicted by mass-segregation arguments) and if it is also rich in recycled pulsar binaries (by analogy with globular clusters), then three-body exchange interactions should produce PSR-BHs in the Galactic Centre. Simple estimates of the formation rate and survival time of these binaries suggest that a few PSR-BHs should be present in the central parsec today. The proposed formation mechanism makes unique predictions for the PSR-BH properties: (1) the binary would reside within ˜1 pc of Sgr A*; (2) the pulsar would be recycled, with a period of ˜1 to a few tens of milliseconds, and a low magnetic field B≲ 1010 G; (3) the binary would have high eccentricity, e˜ 0.8, but with a large scatter and (4) the binary would be relatively wide, with semimajor axis ab˜ 0.1 -≳3 au. The potential discovery of a PSR-BH binary therefore provides a strong motivation for deep, high-frequency radio searches for recycled pulsars towards the Galactic Centre.

AB  - We present the J-band luminosity function (LF) of 1838 mid-infrared and X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the redshift range 0 < z < 5.85. These LFs are constructed by combining the deep multi-wavelength broadband observations from the UV to the mid-IR of the NDWFS Boötes field with the X-ray observations of the XBoötes survey and the spectroscopic observations of the same field by AGES. Our sample is primarily composed of IRAC-selected AGNs, targeted using modifications of the Stern et al. criteria, complemented by MIPS 24 mum and X-ray-selected AGNs to alleviate the biases of IRAC mid-IR selection against z ~ 4.5 quasars and AGNs faint with respect to their hosts. This sample provides an accurate link between low- and high-redshift AGN LFs and does not suffer from the usual incompleteness of optical samples at z ~ 3. We use a set of low-resolution spectral energy distribution templates for AGNs and galaxies presented in a previous paper by Assef et al. to model the selection function of these sources and apply host and reddening corrections. We find that the space density of the brightest quasars strongly decreases from z = 3 to z = 0, while the space density of faint quasars is at least flat, and possibly increasing, over the same redshift range. At z>3, we observe a decrease in the space density of quasars of all brightnesses. We model the LF by a double power law and find that its evolution cannot be described by either pure luminosity or pure density evolution, but must be a combination of both. We used the bright-end slope determined by Croom et al. (2QZ) as a prior to fit the data in order to minimize the effects of our small survey area. The bright-end power-law index of our best-fit model remains consistent with the prior, while the best-fit faint-end index is consistent with the low-redshift measurements based on the 2QZ and 2SLAQ surveys. Our best-fit model generally agrees with the number of bright quasars predicted by other LFs at all redshifts. If we construct the QSO luminosity function using only the IRAC-selected AGNs, we find that the biases inherent to this selection method significantly modify the behavior of the characteristic density phi*(z) only for z < 1 and have no significant impact upon the characteristic magnitude M *,J (z).

AB  - This paper describes a pilot study into the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and the derivation of physical parameters for 19 galaxies observed as part of the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) survey as observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope. For this we have used the pan-spectral fitting tools developed in a series of papers by Dopita and his co-workers. We show that the standard Lee and Draine `astronomical silicate' model cannot provide a good fit to the silicate absorption features as observed in the heavily dust-extinguished ( A V˜50 mag.) starbursts. We have derived an empirical fit to the `starburst silicate' absorption in these objects. This absorption curve is consistent with the silicate grains being systematically larger in starburst environments than in the local Galactic interstellar medium. We demonstrate the sensitivity of the SED fitting to each of the fitted parameters, and derive these parameters for those galaxies which do not have an embedded AGN. This technique is simple and provides reasonably robust and uniform parameters for the starburst, especially as far as the star formation rate, population of old stars, compactness of the starburst region and total foreground extinction are concerned. However, the chemical abundances and the optical extinction cannot be reliably determined by this analysis, and optical SEDs will also be required to provide a complete characterization of the starburst region and of the surrounding galaxy.

AB  - We present a model using the evolution of the stellar population in a starburst galaxy to predict the crystallinity of the silicates in the interstellar medium of this galaxy. We take into account dust production in stellar ejecta, and amorphization and destruction in the interstellar medium and find that a detectable amount of crystalline silicates may be formed, particularly at high star formation rates, and in case supernovae are efficient dust producers. We discuss the effect of dust destruction and amorphization by supernovae, and the effect of a low dust-production efficiency by supernovae, and find that when taking this into account, crystallinity in the interstellar medium becomes hard to detect. Levels of 6.5-13 per cent crystallinity in the interstellar medium of starburst galaxies have been observed and thus we conclude that not all these crystalline silicates can be of stellar origin, and an additional source of crystalline silicates associated with the active galactic nucleus must be present.

AB  - We report initial results from the far-infrared fine structure line observations of a sample of 44 local starbursts, Seyfert galaxies, and infrared luminous galaxies obtained with the PACS spectrometer on board Herschel. We show that the ratio between the far-infrared luminosity and the molecular gas mass, L_FIR/M_H_2, is a much better proxy for the relative brightness of the far-infrared lines than LFIR alone. Galaxies with high L_FIR/M_H_2 ratios tend to have weaker fine structure lines relative to their far-infrared continuum than galaxies with L_FIR/M_H_2≲ 80 L_&sun; M_&sun;^-1. A deficit of the [C II] 158 mum line relative to L FIR was previously found with the Infrared Space Observatory, but now we show for the first time that this is a general aspect of all far-infrared fine structure lines, regardless of their origin in the ionized or neutral phase of the interstellar medium. The L_FIR/M_H_2 value where these line deficits start to manifest is similar to the limit that separates between the two modes of star formation recently found in galaxies on the basis of studies of their gas-star formation relations. Our finding that the properties of the interstellar medium are also significantly different in these regimes provides independent support for the different star-forming relations in normal disk galaxies and major merger systems. We use the spectral synthesis code Cloudy to model the emission of the lines. The expected increase of the ionization parameter with L_FIR/M_H_2 can simultaneously explain the line deficits in the [C II], [N II], and [O I] lines.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.

AB  - Software correlation, where a correlation algorithm written in a high-level language such as C++ is run on commodity computer hardware, has become increasingly attractive for small- to medium-sized and/or bandwidth-constrained radio interferometers. In particular, many long-baseline arrays (which typically have fewer than 20 elements and are restricted in observing bandwidth by costly recording hardware and media) have utilized software correlators for rapid, cost-effective, correlator upgrades to allow compatibility with new, wider-bandwidth, recording systems and to improve correlator flexibility. The DiFX correlator, made publicly available in 2007, has been a popular choice in such upgrades and is now used for production correlation by a number of observatories and research groups worldwide. Here, we describe the evolution in the capabilities of the DiFX correlator over the past three years, including a number of new capabilities, substantial performance improvements, and a large amount of supporting infrastructure to ease use of the code. New capabilities include the ability to correlate a large number of phase centers in a single correlation pass, the extraction of phase-calibration tones, correlation of disparate but overlapping sub-bands, the production of rapidly sampled filter-bank and kurtosis data at minimal cost, and many more. The latest version of the code is at least 15% faster than the original (and in certain situations, many times this value). Finally, we also present detailed test results validating the correctness of the new code.

AB  - Although originally classified as galaxies, Ultra-Compact Dwarfs (UCDs) have many properties in common with globular star clusters. The debate on the origin and nature of UCDs, and the recently discovered ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies which contain very few stars, has motivated us to ask the question `What is a galaxy?' Our aim here is to promote further discussion of how to define a galaxy and, in particular, what separates it from a star cluster. Like most previous definitions, we adopt the requirement of a gravitationally bound stellar system as a minimum. In order to distinguish a dwarf galaxy from a globular cluster, we discuss other possible requirements, such as a minimum size, a long two-body relaxation time, a satellite system, the presence of complex stellar populations and non-baryonic dark matter. We briefly mention the implications of the adoption of each of these definitions. Some special cases of objects with an ambiguous nature are also discussed. Finally, we give our favoured criteria, and in the spirit of `collective wisdom', invite readers to vote on their preferred definition of a galaxy via a dedicated website.

AB  - The masses of supermassive black holes are known to correlate with the properties of the bulge components of their host galaxies. In contrast, they seem not to correlate with galaxy disks. Disk-grown `pseudobulges' are intermediate in properties between bulges and disks; it has been unclear whether they do or do not correlate with black holes in the same way that bulges do. At stake in this issue are conclusions about which parts of galaxies coevolve with black holes, possibly by being regulated by energy feedback from black holes. Here we report pseudobulge classifications for galaxies with dynamically detected black holes and combine them with recent measurements of velocity dispersions in the biggest bulgeless galaxies. These data confirm that black holes do not correlate with disks and show that they correlate little or not at all with pseudobulges. We suggest that there are two different modes of black-hole feeding. Black holes in bulges grow rapidly to high masses when mergers drive gas infall that feeds quasar-like events. In contrast, small black holes in bulgeless galaxies and in galaxies with pseudobulges grow as low-level Seyfert galaxies. Growth of the former is driven by global processes, so the biggest black holes coevolve with bulges, but growth of the latter is driven locally and stochastically, and they do not coevolve with disks and pseudobulges.

AB  - The neutral hydrogen properties of 1822 galaxies are being studied with the Green Bank 100-m and the Parkes 64-m telescopes as part of the 'Cosmic Flows' programme. Observed parameters include systemic velocities, profile linewidths and integrated fluxes. The linewidth information can be combined with the optical and infrared photometry to obtain distances. The 1822 H I observations complement an inventory of archives. All told, H I linewidth information is available for almost all of five samples: (i) luminosity-linewidth correlation calibrators; (ii) zero-point calibrators for the Type Ia supernova scale; (iii) a dense local sample of spiral galaxies with ? within 3000 km s-1; (iv) a sparser sample of 60-mum selected galaxies within 6000 km s-1 that provides an all-sky coverage of our extended supercluster complex; and (v) an even sparser sample of flat galaxies, extreme edge-on spirals, extending in a volume out to 12 000 km s-1. The H I information for 13 941 galaxies, whether from the archives or acquired as part of the Cosmic Flows observational programme, is uniformly re-measured and made available through the Extragalactic Distance Database website.

AB  - We present spectroscopic results for all galaxies observed with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) that also have total infrared fluxes f IR measured with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), also using AKARI photometry when available. Infrared luminosities and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from 8 mum to 160 mum are compared to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission from starburst galaxies or mid-infrared dust continuum from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at rest-frame wavelengths ~8 mum. A total of 301 spectra are analyzed for which IRS and IRAS include the same unresolved source, as measured by the ratio f nu(IRAS 25 mum)/f nu(IRS 25 mum). Sources have 0.004 < z < 0.34 and 42.5 < log L IR < 46.8 (erg s-1) and cover the full range of starburst galaxy and AGN classifications. Individual spectra are provided electronically, but averages and dispersions are presented. We find that log [L IR/nuL nu(7.7 mum)] = 0.74 $\pm$ 0.18 in starbursts, log [L IR/nuL nu(7.7 mum)] = 0.96 $\pm$ 0.26 in composite sources (starburst plus AGN), log [L IR/nuL nu(7.9 mum)] = 0.80 $\pm$ 0.25 in AGNs with silicate absorption, and that log [L IR/nuL nu(7.9 mum)] = 0.51 $\pm$ 0.21 in AGNs with silicate emission. L IR for the most luminous absorption and emission AGNs are similar and 2.5 times larger than for the most luminous starbursts. AGNs have systematically flatter SEDs than starbursts or composites, but their dispersion in SEDs overlaps starbursts. Sources with the strongest far-infrared luminosity from cool dust components are composite sources, indicating that these sources may contain the most obscured starbursts.

AB  - We report deep Green Bank Telescope spectroscopy in the redshifted NH3 (1,1), CS 1-0, and H2CO 000-101 lines from the z ~ 0.685 absorber toward B0218+357. The inversion (NH3) and rotational (CS, H2CO) line frequencies have different dependences on the proton-electron mass ratio mu, implying that a comparison between the line redshifts is sensitive to changes in mu. A joint three-component fit to the NH3, CS, and H2CO lines yields [Deltamu/mu] = (-3.5 $\pm$ 1.2) × 10-7, from z ~ 0.685 to today, where the error includes systematic effects from comparing lines from different species and possible frequency-dependent source morphology. Two additional sources of systematic error remain, due to time variability in the source morphology and velocity offsets between nitrogen-bearing and carbon-bearing species. We find no statistically significant (>=3sigma) evidence for changes in mu and obtain the stringent 3sigma constraint, [Deltamu/mu] < 3.6 × 10-7, over 6.2 Gyr; this is the best present limit on temporal changes in mu from any technique, and for any look-back time, by a factor gsim5.

AB  - We compile a large sample of 120 Seyfert 2 galaxies (Sy2s) which contains 49 hidden broad-line region (HBLR) Sy2s and 71 non-HBLR Sy2s. From the difference in the power sources between two groups, we test whether HBLR Sy2s are dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and whether non-HBLR Sy2s are dominated by starbursts. We show that (1) HBLR Sy2s have larger accretion rates than non-HBLR Sy2s; (2) HBLR Sy2s have larger [Ne V] lambda14.32/[Ne II] lambda12.81 and [O IV] lambda25.89/[Ne II] lambda12.81 line ratios than non-HBLR Sy2s; and (3) HBLR Sy2s have smaller IRAS f 60/f 25 flux ratios, which show the relative strength of the host galaxy and nuclear emission, than non-HBLR Sy2s. Consequently, we suggest that HBLR Sy2s and non-HBLR Sy2s are AGN dominated and starburst dominated, respectively. In addition, non-HBLR Sy2s can be classified into luminous (L [O III]>1041 erg s-1) and less luminous (L [O III] < 1041 erg s-1) samples, when considering only their obscuration. We suggest that (1) the invisibility of polarized broad lines (PBLs) in the luminous non-HBLR Sy2s depends on the obscuration and (2) the invisibility of PBLs in the less luminous non-HBLR Sy2s depends on the very low Eddington ratio rather than the obscuration.

AB  - We present a panoramic atlas of Spitzer/Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra of extragalactic sources collected from the recent literature, with value-added measurements of their spectral features obtained in a homogeneous and concise manner. The atlas covers the full spectrum of the extragalactic Universe and includes star-forming galaxies, obscured and unobscured active galaxies, luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, and hybrid objects. Measured features such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the strength of the silicates in emission or absorption around 9.7 mum, rest-frame monochromatic luminosities or colours, combined with measurements derived from spectral decomposition are used to establish diagnostics that allow for classification of sources, based on their infrared properties alone. Average templates of the various classes are also derived. The full atlas with the value-added measurements and ancillary archival data are publicly available at , with full references to the original data.

AB  - Using a combination of self-consistent and test-particle techniques, Identikit 1 provided a way to vary the initial geometry of a galactic collision and instantly visualize the outcome. Identikit 2 uses the same techniques to define a mapping from the current morphology and kinematics of a tidal encounter back to the initial conditions. By requiring that various regions along a tidal feature all originate from a single disc with a unique orientation, this mapping can be used to derive the initial collision geometry. In addition, Identikit 2 offers a robust way to measure how well a particular model reproduces the morphology and kinematics of a pair of interacting galaxies. A set of eight self-consistent simulations is used to demonstrate the algorithm's ability to search a ten-dimensional parameter space and find near-optimal matches; all eight systems are successfully reconstructed.

AB  - Recently spatial as well as temporal variations of the fine structure constant alpha have been reported. We show that a ``runaway domain wall'', which arises for the scalar field potential without minima, can account for such variations simultaneously. The time variation is induced by a runaway potential and the spatial variation is induced by the formation of a domain wall. The model is consistent with the current cosmological data and can be tested by the future experiments to test the equivalence principle.

AB  - In order to investigate the relationship between the local environment and the properties of natal star clusters, we obtained radio observations of 25 star-forming galaxies within 20 Mpc using the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. Natal star-forming regions can be identified by their characteristic thermal radio emission, which is manifest in their spectral index at centimeter wavelengths. The host galaxies in our sample were selected based upon their likelihood of harboring young star formation. In star-forming regions, the ionizing flux of massive embedded stars powers the dominant thermal free-free emission of those sources, resulting in a spectral index of alpha >~ -0.2 (where S nu vprop nualpha), which we compute. With the current sensitivity, we find that of the 25 galaxies in this sample only 5 have radio sources with spectral indices that are only consistent with a thermal origin, 4 have radio sources that are only consistent with a non-thermal origin, 6 have radio sources whose nature is ambiguous due to uncertainties in the spectral index, and 16 have no detected radio sources. For those sources that appear to be dominated by thermal emission, we infer the ionizing flux of the star clusters and the number of equivalent O7.5 V stars that are required to produce the observed radio flux densities. The most radio-luminous clusters that we detect have an equivalent of ~7 × 103 O7.5 V stars, and the smallest only have an equivalent of ~102 O7.5 V stars; thus these star-forming regions span the range of large OB associations to moderate ``super star clusters.'' With the current detection limits, we also place upper limits on the masses of clusters that could have recently formed; for a number of galaxies we can conclusively rule out the presence of natal clusters significantly more massive than the Galactic star-forming region W49A (~5 × 104 M sun). The dearth of current massive cluster formation in these galaxies suggests that either their current star formation intensities have fallen to near or below that of the Milky Way and/or the evolutionary state that gives rise to thermal radio emission is short-lived.

AB  - The Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey has been operating since 2008 February on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope using the AAOmega fibre-fed spectrograph facility to acquire spectra with a resolution of R≈ 1300 for 120 862 Sloan Digital Sky Survey selected galaxies. The target catalogue constitutes three contiguous equatorial regions centred at 9h (G09), 12h (G12) and 14.5h (G15) each of 12 × 4 deg2 to limiting fluxes of rpet < 19.4, rpet < 19.8 and rpet < 19.4 mag, respectively (and additional limits at other wavelengths). Spectra and reliable redshifts have been acquired for over 98 per cent of the galaxies within these limits. Here we present the survey footprint, progression, data reduction, redshifting, re-redshifting, an assessment of data quality after 3 yr, additional image analysis products (including ugrizYJHK photometry, Sérsic profiles and photometric redshifts), observing mask and construction of our core survey catalogue (GamaCore). From this we create three science-ready catalogues: GamaCoreDR1 for public release, which includes data acquired during year 1 of operations within specified magnitude limits (2008 February to April); GamaCoreMainSurvey containing all data above our survey limits for use by the GAMA Team and collaborators; and GamaCoreAtlasSV containing year 1, 2 and 3 data matched to Herschel-ATLAS science demonstration data.

AB  - We report on the results of observations in the CO(1-0) transition of a complete sample of Southern, intermediate-redshift (z= 0.2-0.5) ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) using the Mopra 22-m telescope. The 11 ULIRGs with LFIR > 1012.5 L&sun; south of delta=-12$\,^\circ$ were observed with integration times that varied between 5 and 24 h. Four marginal detections were obtained for individual targets in the sample. The 'stacked' spectrum of the entire sample yields a high significance, 10sigma detection of the CO(1-0) transition at an average redshift of z= 0.38. The tightest correlation of LFIR and LCO for published low-redshift ULIRG samples (z < 0.2) is obtained after normalization of both these measures to a fixed dust temperature. With this normalization the relationship is linear. The distribution of dust-to-molecular hydrogen gas mass displays a systematic increase in dust-to-gas mass with galaxy luminosity for low-redshift samples, but this ratio declines dramatically for intermediate-redshift ULIRGs down to values comparable to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The upper envelope to the distribution of ULIRG molecular mass as function of look-back time demonstrates a dramatic rise by almost an order of magnitude from the current epoch out to 5 Gyr. This increase in maximum ULIRG gas mass with look-back time is even more rapid than that of the star formation rate density.

AB  - We present the rest-frame 200-320 mum spectrum of the z = 3.91 quasar APM 08279+5255, obtained with Z-Spec at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. In addition to the J = 8 --> 7 to J = 13 --> 12 CO rotational transitions which dominate the CO cooling, we find six transitions of water originating at energy levels ranging up to 643 K. Most are first detections at high redshift, and we have confirmed one transition with CARMA. The CO cooling is well described by our X-ray dominated region (XDR) model, assuming L 1-100 keV ~ 1 × 1046 erg s-1, and that the gas is distributed over a 550-pc size scale, as per the now-favored mu = 4 lensing model. The total observed cooling in water corresponds to 6.5 × 109 L sun, comparable to that of CO. We compare the water spectrum with that of Mrk 231, finding that the intensity ratios among the high-lying lines are similar, but with a total luminosity scaled up by a factor of ~50. Using this scaling, we estimate an average water abundance relative to H2 of 1.4 × 10-7, a good match to the prediction of the chemical network in the XDR model. As with Mrk 231, the high-lying water transitions are excited radiatively via absorption in the rest-frame far-infrared, and we show that the powerful dust continuum in APM 08279+5255 is more than sufficient to pump this massive reservoir of warm water vapor.

AB  - Introductory physics and astronomy courses commonly use Wien's displacement law to explain the colors of blackbodies, including the Sun and other stars, in terms of their temperatures. We argue here that focusing on the peak of the blackbody spectrum is misleading for three reasons. First, the Planck curve is too broad for an individual spectral color to stand out. Second, the location of the peak of the Planck curve depends on the choice of the independent variable in the plot. And third, Wien's displacement law is seldom used in actual practice to find a temperature and direct fitting to the Planck function is preferable. We discuss these flaws and argue that, at the introductory level, presentation of blackbody radiation in terms of photon statistics would be more effective pedagogically. The average energy of the emitted photons would then be presented in place of Wien's displacement law, and discussion of the Stefan-Boltzmann law would include the total number of photons emitted per second. Finally, we suggest that the Planck spectrum is most appropriately plotted as a ``spectral energy density per fractional bandwidth distribution,'' using a logarithmic scale for the wavelength or frequency.

AB  - This work presents a method for determining the accuracy of a source finder algorithm for spectral line radio astronomy data and the Source Finder Accuracy Evaluator (SFAE), a program that implements this method. The accuracy of a source finder is defined in terms of its completeness, reliability, and accuracy of the parameterisation of the sources that were found. These values are calculated by executing the source finder on an image with a known source catalogue, then comparing the output of the source finder to the known catalogue. The intended uses of SFAE include determining the most accurate source finders for use in a survey, determining the types of radio sources a particular source finder is capable of accurately locating, and identifying optimum parameters and areas of improvement for these algorithms. This paper demonstrates a sample of accuracy information that can be obtained through this method, using a simulated ASKAP data cube and the duchamp source finder.

AB  - We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, in conjunction with a number of additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter LambdaCDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter and energy densities, Omega b  h 2, Omega c  h 2, and OmegaLambda, are each determined to a precision of ~1.5%. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5sigma level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional LambdaCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their LambdaCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r < 0.13 (95% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to \Omega _k = -0.0027^+ 0.0039_- 0.0038; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to ∑m nu < 0.44 eV (95% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N eff = 3.84 $\pm$ 0.40, when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.

Temperature and polarization sky maps are examined to separate cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from foreground emission, and both types of signals are analyzed in detail. We provide new point source catalogs as well as new diffuse and point source foreground masks. An updated template-removal process is used for cosmological analysis; new foreground fits are performed, and new foreground-reduced CMB maps are presented. We now implement an optimal C --1 weighting to compute the temperature angular power spectrum. The WMAP mission has resulted in a highly constrained LambdaCDM cosmological model with precise and accurate parameters in agreement with a host of other cosmological measurements. When WMAP data are combined with finer scale CMB, baryon acoustic oscillation, and Hubble constant measurements, we find that big bang nucleosynthesis is well supported and there is no compelling evidence for a non-standard number of neutrino species (N eff = 3.84 $\pm$ 0.40). The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is t 0 = 13.772 $\pm$ 0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H 0 = 69.32 $\pm$ 0.80 km s--1 Mpc--1. Inflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian random phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity, reported earlier by the WMAP team, now has high statistical significance (ns = 0.9608 $\pm$ 0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean (\Omega _k = -0.0027^+ 0.0039_-0.0038). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a reduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the standard six-parameter LambdaCDM model, based on CMB data alone. For a model including tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a factor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in accord with the CMB predictions, and the combined data reduces the cosmological parameter volume even further. With no significant anomalies and an adequate goodness of fit, the inflationary flat LambdaCDM model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted in WMAP data stands as the standard model of cosmology.

AB  - Over the past decade, observations of the cool interstellar medium (ISM) in distant galaxies via molecular and atomic fine structure line (FSL) emission have gone from a curious look into a few extreme, rare objects to a mainstream tool for studying galaxy formation out to the highest redshifts. Molecular gas has been observed in close to 200 galaxies at z > 1, including numerous AGN host-galaxies out to z ˜ 7, highly star-forming submillimeter galaxies, and increasing samples of main-sequence color-selected star-forming galaxies at z ˜ 1.5 to 2.5. Studies have moved well beyond simple detections to dynamical imaging at kiloparsec-scale resolution and multiline, multispecies studies that determine the physical conditions in the ISM in early galaxies. Observations of the cool gas are the required complement to studies of the stellar density and star-formation history of the Universe as they reveal the phase of the ISM that immediately precedes star formation in galaxies. Current observations suggest that the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic star-formation rate density from z ˜ 0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar increase in the gas-to-stellar mass ratio in star-forming disk galaxies. Progress has been made in determining the CO luminosity to H2 mass conversion factor at high z, and the dichotomy between high versus low values for main-sequence versus starburst galaxies, respectively, appears to persist with increasing redshift, with a likely dependence on metallicity and other local physical conditions. There may also be two sequences in the relationship between star-formation rate and gas mass: one for starbursts, in which the gas consumption timescale is short (a few 107 years), and one for main sequence galaxies, with an order of magnitude longer gas consumption timescale. Studies of atomic FSL emission are rapidly progressing, with some tens of galaxies detected in the exceptionally bright [Cii] 158-mum line to date. The [Cii] line is proving to be a unique tracer of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe and, together with other atomic FSLs, has the potential to be the most direct means of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the first galaxies during cosmic reionization.

AB  - The estimated stellar masses of galaxies are widely used to characterize how the galaxy population evolves over cosmic time. If stellar masses can be estimated in a robust manner, free from any bias, global diagnostics such as the stellar mass function can be used to constrain the physics of galaxy formation. We explore how galaxy stellar masses, estimated by fitting broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with stellar population models, can be biased as a result of commonly adopted assumptions for the star formation and chemical enrichment histories, recycled fractions and dust attenuation curves of galaxies. We apply the observational technique of broad-band SED fitting to model galaxy SEDs calculated by the theoretical galaxy formation model GALFORM, isolating the effect of each of these assumptions. We find that, averaged over the entire galaxy population, the common assumption of exponentially declining star formation histories does not, by itself, adversely affect stellar mass estimation. However, we also show that this result does not hold when considering galaxies that have undergone a recent burst of star formation. We show that fixing the metallicity in SED fitting or using sparsely sampled metallicity grids can introduce mass-dependent systematics into stellar mass estimates. We find that the common assumption of a star-dust geometry corresponding to a uniform foreground dust screen can cause the stellar masses of dusty model galaxies to be significantly underestimated. Finally, we show that stellar mass functions recovered by applying SED fitting to model galaxies at high redshift can differ significantly in both shape and normalization from the intrinsic mass functions predicted by a given model. In particular, the effects of dust can reduce the normalization at the high-mass end by up to 0.6 dex in some cases. Given these differences, our methodology of using stellar masses estimated from model galaxy SEDs offers a new, self-consistent way to compare model predictions with observations. We conclude that great care should be taken when comparing theoretical galaxy formation models to observational results based on the estimated stellar masses of high-redshift galaxies.

AB  - Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass [Formula: see text] and the velocity dispersion sigma of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from [Formula: see text] in brightest cluster ellipticals to [Formula: see text] in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade.   New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105-106M&sun; are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any [Formula: see text] correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution.   The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with [Formula: see text] suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between [Formula: see text] and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in [Formula: see text] correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.

AB  - We demonstrate a new multiwavelength technique for two-dimensional parametric modelling of galaxy surface-brightness profiles, which we have incorporated into the widely used software GALFIT. Our new method, named GALFITM, extends GALFIT3's current single-band fitting process by simultaneously using multiple images of the same galaxy to constrain a wavelength-dependent model. Each standard profile parameter may vary as a function of wavelength, with a user-definable degree of smoothness, from constant to fully free. The performance of GALFITM is evaluated by fitting elliptical Sérsic profiles to ugriz imaging data for 4026 galaxies, comprising the original Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging for 163 low-redshift (v ≲ 7000 km s-1) galaxies and 3863 artificially redshifted (0.01 ≲ z ≲ 0.25) images of the same galaxies. Comparing results from single-band and multiband techniques, we show that GALFITM significantly improves the extraction of information, particularly from bands with low signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. u and z SDSS bands) when combined with higher signal-to-noise images. We also study systematic trends in the recovered parameters, particularly Sérsic index, that appear when one performs measurements of the same galaxies at successively higher redshifts. We argue that it is vital that studies investigating the evolution of galaxy structure are careful to avoid or correct for these biases. The resulting multiband photometric structural parameters for our sample of 163 galaxies are provided. We demonstrate the importance of considering multiband measurements by showing that the Sérsic indices of spiral galaxies increase to redder wavelengths, as expected for composite bulge-disc systems. Finally, for the ellipticals in our sample, which should be well represented by single-Sérsic models, we compare our measured parameters to those from previous studies.

AB  - We report the discovery of a remarkable ultra-compact dwarf galaxy around the massive Virgo elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60), which we call M60-UCD1. With a dynamical mass of 2.0 × 108 M &sun; but a half-light radius of only ~24 pc, M60-UCD1 is more massive than any ultra-compact dwarfs of comparable size, and is arguably the densest galaxy known in the local universe. It has a two-component structure well fit by a sum of Sérsic functions, with an elliptical, compact (rh = 14 pc n ~ 3.3) inner component and a round, exponential, extended (rh = 49 pc) outer component. Chandra data reveal a variable central X-ray source with LX ~ 1038 erg s--1 that could be an active galactic nucleus associated with a massive black hole or a low-mass X-ray binary. Analysis of optical spectroscopy shows the object to be old (gsim 10 Gyr) and of solar metallicity, with elevated [Mg/Fe] and strongly enhanced [N/Fe] that indicates light-element self-enrichment; such self-enrichment may be generically present in dense stellar systems. The velocity dispersion (sigma ~ 70 km s--1) and resulting dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M/LV = 4.9 $\pm$ 0.7) are consistent with---but slightly higher than---expectations for an old, metal-rich stellar population with a Kroupa initial mass function. The presence of a massive black hole or a mild increase in low-mass stars or stellar remnants is therefore also consistent with this M/LV . The stellar density of the galaxy is so high that no dynamical signature of dark matter is expected. However, the properties of M60-UCD1 suggest an origin in the tidal stripping of a nucleated galaxy with MB ~ --18 to --19.

AB  - Stellar bars can lead to gas inflow toward the center of a galaxy and stimulate nuclear star formation. However, there is no compelling evidence on whether they also feed a central supermassive black hole: by measuring the fractions of barred active and inactive galaxies, previous studies have yielded conflicting results. In this paper, we aim to understand the lack of observational evidence for bar-driven active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity by studying a sample of 41 nearby (d < 35 Mpc) barred galaxies from the Spitzer Survey for Stellar Structure in Galaxies. We use Chandra observations to measure nuclear 2-10 keV X-ray luminosities and estimate Eddington ratios, together with Spitzer 3.6 mum imaging to quantify the strength of the stellar bar in two independent ways: (1) from its structure, as traced by its ellipticity and boxiness, and (2) from its gravitational torque Qb , taken as the maximum ratio of the tangential force to the mean background radial force. In this way, rather than discretizing the presence of both stellar bars and nuclear activity, we are able to account for the continuum of bar strengths and degrees of AGN activity. We find nuclear X-ray sources in 31 out of 41 galaxies with median X-ray luminosity and Eddington ratio of L X = 4.3 × 1038 erg s--1 and L bol/L Edd = 6.9 × 10--6, respectively, consistent with low-luminosity AGN activity. Including upper limits for those galaxies without nuclear detections, we find no significant correlation between any of the bar strength indicators and the degree of nuclear activity, irrespective of galaxy luminosity, stellar mass, Hubble type, or bulge size. Strong bars do not favor brighter or more efficient nuclear activity, implying that at least for the low-luminosity regime, supermassive black hole fueling is not closely connected to large-scale features.

AB  - Blazars are the most extreme class of active galactic nuclei. Despite a previous investigation at 102 MHz for a small sample of BL Lac objects and our recent analysis of blazars detected in the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey, a systematic study of the blazar spectral properties at frequencies below 100 MHz has been never carried out. In this paper, we present the first analysis of the radio spectral behavior of blazars based on the recent Very Large Array Low-frequency Sky Survey (VLSS) at 74 MHz. We search for blazar counterparts in the VLSS catalog, confirming that they are detected at 74 MHz. We then show that blazars present radio-flat spectra (i.e., radio spectral indices of ~0.5) when evaluated, which also about an order of magnitude in frequency lower than previous analyses. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of the blazars-radio galaxies connection since the low-frequency radio data provide a new diagnostic tool to verify the expectations of the unification scenario for radio-loud active galaxies.

AB  - Advanced Large Homogeneous Area Medium Band Redshift Astronomical (ALHAMBRA) is photometric survey designed to trace the cosmic evolution and cosmic variance. It covers a large area of ˜4 deg2 in eight fields, where seven fields overlap with other surveys, allowing us to have complementary data in other wavelengths. All observations were carried out in 20 continuous, medium band (30 nm width) optical and 3 near-infrared (JHK) bands, providing the precise measurements of photometric redshifts. In addition, morphological classification of galaxies is crucial for any kind of galaxy formation and cosmic evolution studies, providing the information about star formation histories, their environment and interactions, internal perturbations, etc. We present a morphological classification of >40 000 galaxies in the ALHAMBRA survey. We associate to every galaxy a probability to be early type using the automated Bayesian code GALSVM. Despite of the spatial resolution of the ALHAMBRA images (˜1 arcsec), for 22 051 galaxies, we obtained the contamination by other type of less than 10 per cent. Of those, 1640 and 10 322 galaxies are classified as early- (down to redshifts ˜0.5) and late-type (down to redshifts ˜1.0), respectively, with magnitudes F613W <= 22.0. In addition, for magnitude range 22.0 < F613W <= 23.0, we classified other 10 089 late-type galaxies with redshifts <=1.3. We show that the classified objects populate the expected regions in the colour-mass and colour-magnitude planes. The presented data set is especially attractive given the homogeneous multiwavelength coverage available in the ALHAMBRA fields, and is intended to be used in a variety of scientific applications. The low-contamination catalogue (<10 per cent) is made publicly available with this paper.

AB  - We present observations of 18 galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey made with the SPIRAL optical integral field unit (IFU) on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The galaxies are selected to have a narrow range in stellar mass (6 × 109 < M* < 2 × 1010 M&sun;) in order to focus on the effects of environment. Local galaxy environments are measured quantitatively using fifth nearest neighbour surface densities. We find that the total star formation rates (SFR) measured from the IFU data are consistent with total SFRs measured from aperture correcting either GAMA or Sloan Digital Sky Survey single-fibre observations. The mean differences are SFRGAMA/SFRIFU = 1.26 $\pm$ 0.23, sigma = 0.90 and for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we similarly find SFRBrinchmann/SFRIFU = 1.34 $\pm$ 0.17, sigma = 0.67. Examining the relationships with environment, we find that off-centre and clumpy Halpha emission is not significantly dependent on environment, being present in 2/7 (29^+20_-11 per cent) galaxies in high-density environments (>0.77 Mpc-2), and 5/11 (45^+15_-13 per cent) galaxies in low-density environments (<0.77 Mpc-2). We find a weak but not significant relationship of the total SFRs of star-forming galaxies with environment. Due to the size of our sample and the scatter observed we do not draw a definitive conclusion about a possible SFR dependence on environment. Examining the spatial distribution of the Halpha emission, we find no evidence for a change in shape or amplitude of the radial profile of star-forming galaxies with environment. If these observations are borne out in larger samples, this would infer that any environment-driven star formation suppression must either act very rapidly (the `infall-and-quench' model) or that galaxies must evolve in a density-dependent manner (an `in situ evolution' model).

AB  - We report the latest Planet Hunter results, including PH2 b, a Jupiter-size (R PL = 10.12 $\pm$ 0.56 R ⊕) planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a solar-type star. PH2 b was elevated from candidate status when a series of false-positive tests yielded a 99.9% confidence level that transit events detected around the star KIC 12735740 had a planetary origin. Planet Hunter volunteers have also discovered 42 new planet candidates in the Kepler public archive data, of which 33 have at least 3 transits recorded. Most of these transit candidates have orbital periods longer than 100 days and 20 are potentially located in the habitable zones of their host stars. Nine candidates were detected with only two transit events and the prospective periods are longer than 400 days. The photometric models suggest that these objects have radii that range between those of Neptune and Jupiter. These detections nearly double the number of gas-giant planet candidates orbiting at habitable-zone distances. We conducted spectroscopic observations for nine of the brighter targets to improve the stellar parameters and we obtained adaptive optics imaging for four of the stars to search for blended background or foreground stars that could confuse our photometric modeling. We present an iterative analysis method to derive the stellar and planet properties and uncertainties by combining the available spectroscopic parameters, stellar evolution models, and transiting light curve parameters, weighted by the measurement errors. Planet Hunters is a citizen science project that crowd sources the assessment of NASA Kepler light curves. The discovery of these 43 planet candidates demonstrates the success of citizen scientists at identifying planet candidates, even in longer period orbits with only two or three transit events.  .

The majority of the line deficits are consistent with dustier H II regions, but part of the [C II] deficit may arise from an additional mechanism, plausibly charged dust grains. This is consistent with some of the [C II] originating from photodissociation regions or the interstellar medium (ISM). We derive relations between far-IR line luminosities and both the IR luminosity and star formation rate. We find that [N II] and both [O I] lines are good tracers of the IR luminosity and star formation rate. In contrast, [C II] is a poor tracer of the IR luminosity and star formation rate, and does not improve as a tracer of either quantity if the [C II] deficit is accounted for. The continuum luminosity densities also correlate with the IR luminosity and star formation rate. We derive ranges for the gas density and ultraviolet radiation intensity of 101 < n < 102.5 and 102.2 < G 0 < 103.6, respectively. These ranges depend on optical type, the importance of star formation, and merger stage. We do not find relationships between far-IR line properties and several other parameters: active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, merger stage, mid-IR excitation, and SMBH mass. We conclude that these far-IR lines arise from gas heated by starlight, and that they are not strongly influenced by AGN activity.

AB  - We use multiwavelength (0.12-500 mum) photometry from Herschel-ATLAS, WISE, UKIDSS, SDSS and GALEX to study 23 nearby spheroidal galaxies with prominent dust lanes (DLSGs). DLSGs are considered to be remnants of recent minor mergers, making them ideal laboratories for studying both the interstellar medium (ISM) of spheroids and minor-merger-driven star formation in the nearby Universe. The DLSGs exhibit star formation rates (SFRs) between 0.01 and 10 M&sun; yr-1, with a median of 0.26 M&sun; yr-1 (a factor of 3.5 greater than the average SG). The median dust mass, dust-to-stellar mass ratio and dust temperature in these galaxies are around 107.6 M&sun;, ≈0.05 per cent and ≈19.5 K, respectively. The dust masses are at least a factor of 50 greater than that expected from stellar mass loss and, like the SFRs, show no correlation with galaxy luminosity, suggesting that both the ISM and the star formation have external drivers. Adopting literature gas-to-dust ratios and star formation histories derived from fits to the panchromatic photometry, we estimate that the median current and initial gas-to-stellar mass ratios in these systems are ≈4 and ≈7 per cent, respectively. If, as indicated by recent work, minor mergers that drive star formation in spheroids with (NUV - r) > 3.8 (the colour range of our DLSGs) have stellar mass ratios between 1:6 and 1:10, then the satellite gas fractions are likely >=50 per cent.

AB  - Studies of stellar populations, understood to mean collections of stars with common spatial, kinematic, chemical, and/or age distributions, have been reinvigorated during the past decade by the advent of large-area sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Two-Micron All Sky Survey, the Radial Velocity Experiment, and others. We review recent analyses of these data that, together with theoretical and modeling advances, are revolutionizing our understanding of the nature of the Milky Way and galaxy formation and evolution in general. The formation of galaxies like the Milky Way was long thought to be a steady process leading to a smooth distribution of stars. However, the abundance of substructure in the multidimensional space of various observables, such as position, kinematics, and metallicity, is now proven beyond doubt and demonstrates the importance of mergers in the growth of galaxies. Unlike smooth models that involve simple components, the new data reviewed here clearly exhibit many irregular structures, such as the Sagittarius dwarf tidal stream and the Virgo and Pisces overdensities in the halo and the Monoceros stream closer to the Galactic plane. These recent developments have made it clear that the Milky Way is a complex and dynamic structure, one that is still being shaped by the merging of neighboring smaller galaxies. We also briefly discuss the next generation of wide-field sky surveys, such as SkyMapper, Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System, Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics, and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will improve measurement precision manyfold and include billions of individual stars. The ultimate goal, development of a coherent and detailed story of the assembly and evolutionary history of the Milky Way and other large spirals like it, now appears well within reach.

AB  - We present a detailed photometric study and measurements of spiral arm pitch angles for a sample of 50 non-barred or weakly barred grand-design spiral galaxies selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In order to find pitch angles, we used a new method based on the window Fourier analysis of their images. This method allows us not only to infer the average pitch angle, but to obtain its value as a function of galactocentric radius as well. Our main results are as follows: (1) Spiral arms of most galaxies cannot be described by a single value of the pitch angle. About 2/3 of galaxies demonstrate pitch angle variations exceeding 20 per cent. In most galaxies in the sample their pitch angle decreases by increasing the distance from the centre. (2) Pitch angle variations correlate with the properties of galaxies - with the shape of the surface brightness distribution (envelope-type or truncated disc), and with the sign of stellar disc colour gradient. (3) More luminous and bright bulges produce more tightly wound spiral arms, that is in agreement with current models for spiral arms formation.

AB  - We examine the use of submm recombination lines of H, He and He$^+$ to probe the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) luminosity of starbursts (SB) and AGN. We find that the submm recombination lines of H, He and He$^+$ are in fact extremely reliable and quantitative probes of the EUV continuum at 13.6 eV to above 54.6 eV. At submm wavelengths, the recombination lines originate from low energy levels (n = 20 -- 50). The maser amplification, which poses significant problems for quantitative interpretation of the higher n, radio frequency recombination lines, is insignificant. Lastly, at submm wavelengths the dust extinction is minimal. The submm line luminosities are therefore directly proportional to the emission measures ($EM_ION = n_e \times n_ion \times volume$) of their ionized regions. We also find that the expected line fluxes are detectable with ALMA and can be imaged at $\sim0.1$\arcsec ~resolution in low redshift ULIRGs. Imaging of the HI lines will provide accurate spatial and kinematic mapping of the star formation distribution in low-z IR-luminous galaxies. And the relative fluxes of the HI and HeII recombination lines will strongly constrain the relative contributions of starbursts and AGN to the luminosity. The HI lines should also provide an avenue to constraining the submm dust extinction curve.

AB  - Disk galaxies evolve over time through processes that may rearrange both the radial mass profile and the metallicity distribution within the disk. This review of such slow changes is largely, though not entirely, restricted to internally-driven processes that can be distinguished from evolution driven by galaxy interactions. It both describes our current understanding of disk evolution, and identifies areas where more work is needed. Stellar disks are heated through spiral scattering, which increases random motion components in the plane, while molecular clouds redirect some fraction of the random energy into vertical motion. The recently discovered process of radial migration at the corotation resonance of a transient spiral mode does not alter the underlying structure of the disk, since it neither heats the disk nor causes it to spread, but it does have a profound effect on the expected distribution of metallicities among the disk stars. Bars in disks are believed to be major drivers of secular evolution through interactions with the outer disk and with the halo. Once the material that makes up galaxy disks is converted into stars, their overall angular momentum distribution cannot change by much, but that of the gas is generally far more liable to rearrangement, allowing rings and pseudo-bulges to form. While simulations are powerful tools from which we have learned a great deal, those of disks may suffer from collisional relaxation that requires results to be interpreted with caution.

AB  - We investigate the evolution of galactic discs in N-body tree-SPH simulations. We find that discs, initially truncated at three scale-lengths, can triple their radial extent, solely driven by secular evolution. At the same time, the initial radial metallicity gradients are flattened and even reversed in the outer discs. Both Type I (single exponential) and Type II (down-turning) observed disc surface-brightness profiles can be explained by our findings. We show that profiles with breaks beyond the bar's outer Lindblad resonance, at present only explained as the effect of star-formation threshold, can occur even if no star formation is considered. We explain these results with the strong angular momentum outward transfer, resulting from torques and radial migration associated with multiple patterns, such as central bars and spiral waves of different multiplicity. We find that even for stars ending up on cold orbits, the changes in angular momentum exhibit complex structure as a function of radius, unlike the expected effect of transient spirals alone. We show that the bars in all of our simulations are the most effective drivers of radial migration through their corotation resonance, throughout the 3 Gyr of evolution studied. Focussing on one of our models, we find evidence for non-linear coupling among m = 1,2,3 and 4 density waves, where m is the pattern multiplicity. In this way the waves involved conspire to carry the energy and angular momentum extracted by the first mode from the inner parts of the disc much farther out than a single mode could. We suggest that the naturally occurring larger resonance widths at galactic radii beyond four scale-lengths may have profound consequences on the formation and location of breaks in disc density profiles, provided spirals are present at such large distances. We also consider the effect of gas inflow and show that when in-plane smooth gas accretion of ~5 M&sun;/yr is included, the outer discs become more unstable, leading to a strong increase in the stellar velocity dispersion. This, in turn, causes the formation of a Type III (up-turning) profile in the old stellar population. We propose that observations of Type III surface brightness profiles, combined with an up-turn in the stellar velocity dispersions beyond the disc break, could be a signature of ongoing gas-accretion. The results of this study suggest that disc outskirts comprised of stars migrated from the inner disc would have relatively large radial velocity dispersions (>30 km s-1 at 6 scale-lengths for Milky Way-size systems), and significant thickness when seen edge-on.

AB  - The distributions of galaxy properties vary with environment, and are often multimodal, suggesting that the galaxy population may be a combination of multiple components. The behaviour of these components versus environment holds details about the processes of galaxy development. To release this information we apply a novel, non-parametric statistical technique, identifying four components present in the distribution of galaxy Halpha emission-line equivalent widths. We interpret these components as passive, star forming and two varieties of active galactic nuclei. Independent of this interpretation, the properties of each component are remarkably constant as a function of environment. Only their relative proportions display substantial variation. The galaxy population thus appears to comprise distinct components which are individually independent of environment, with galaxies rapidly transitioning between components as they move into denser environments.

AB  - An improved algorithm for extracting various types of symmetries from galaxy images is introduced. It preserves the nonlinear shapes of the spiral arms without introducing false interarm components, and it displays the m = 2, 3, 4, etc. subcomponents in whole galaxies all at once to avoid confusion with localized star formation and foreground stars. The algorithm is applied to 18 galaxies with various types of spirals. Conventional Fourier transform techniques are also used to study the arm structures. Underlying three-arm spirals are found to be common in the present sample, and a few galaxies have a complex four- or five-arm system, too. To check whether this structure is sensible, the termination radii of the two-, three-, and four-arm spirals are compared to the corresponding resonance radii predicted from theory. The symmetric components in nearly all of the galaxies are found to end at their outer wave-epicycle resonances.

AB  - A comprehensive review of the theory of galactic dynamics is presented. Key empirical facts about stellar systems are briefly reviewed, and the ingredients needed to construct galaxy models are assembled, including potential theory, stellar orbits, and the theory of the equilibrium configurations of stellar systems. The stability of these configurations and the theory of spiral structures are discussed. Collisions and encounters between stellar systems are considered, and two-body realization and the approach to statistical equilibrium in star clusters are addressed. It is shown how the observable properties of galaxies such as their luminosities and colors are changed by the aging of their constituent stellar populations. Finally, it is shown that most of the mass in the universe is locked up in some still invisible form.

AB  - We analyse a set of collisionless disc galaxy simulations to study the consequences of bar formation and evolution on the M-sigma relation of supermassive black holes. The redistribution of angular momentum driven by bars leads to a mass increase within the central region, raising the velocity dispersion of the bulge, sigma, on average by ~12% and as much as ~20%. If a disc galaxy with a SMBH satisfying the M-sigma relation forms a bar, and the SMBH does not grow in the process, then the increase in sigma moves the galaxy off the M-sigma relation. We explore various effects that can affect this result including contamination from the disc and anisotropy. The displacement from the M-sigma relation for individual model barred galaxies correlates with both M(B)/M(B+D) and beta_phi(B+D) measured within the effective radius of the bulge. Overall, this process leads to an M-sigma for barred galaxies offset from that of unbarred galaxies, as well as an increase in its scatter. We assemble samples of unbarred and barred galaxies with classical bulges and find tentative hints of an offset between the two consistent with the predicted. Including all barred galaxies, rather than just those with a classical bulge, leads to a significantly larger offset.

AB  - We investigate the visibility of galactic bars and spiral structure in the distant universe by artificially redshifting 101 B-band CCD images of local spiral galaxies from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey. These local galaxy images represent a much fairer statistical baseline than the galaxy atlas images presented by Frei et al. in 1995, the most commonly used calibration sample for morphological work at high redshifts. Our artificially redshifted images correspond to Hubble Space Telescope I814-band observations of the local galaxy sample seen at z=0.7, with integration times matching those of both the very deep northern Hubble Deep Field (HDF) data and the much shallower HDF flanking field observations. The expected visibility of galactic bars is probed in two ways: (1) using traditional visual classification and (2) by charting the changing shape of the galaxy distribution in ``Hubble space,'' a quantitative two-parameter description of galactic structure that maps closely onto Hubble's original tuning fork. Both analyses suggest that over two-thirds of strongly barred luminous local spirals (i.e., objects classified as SB in the Third Reference Catalogue) would still be classified as strongly barred at z=0.7 in the HDF data. Under the same conditions, most weakly barred spirals (classified SAB in the Third Reference Catalogue) would be classified as regular spirals. The corresponding visibility of spiral structure is assessed visually, by comparing luminosity classifications for the artificially redshifted sample with the corresponding luminosity classifications from the Revised Shapley-Ames Catalog. We find that for exposure times similar to that of the HDF, spiral structure should be detectable in most luminous (MB~M*) low-inclination spiral galaxies at z=0.7 in which it is present. However, obvious spiral structure is only detectable in ~30% of comparable galaxies in the HDF flanking field data using the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2. Our study of artificially redshifted local galaxy images suggests that, when viewed at similar resolution, noise level, and redshift-corrected wavelength, barred spirals are less common at z~0.7 than they are at z=0.0, although more data are needed to definitively rule out the possibility that cosmic variance is responsible for much of this effect.

AB  - Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) catalogs, we examined the optical environments around double-lobed radio sources. Previous studies have shown that multi-component radio sources exhibiting some degree of bending between components are likely to be found in galaxy clusters. Often this radio emission is associated with a cD-type galaxy at the center of a cluster. We cross-correlated the SDSS and FIRST catalogs and measured the richness of the cluster environments surrounding both bent and straight multi-component radio sources. This led to the discovery and classification of a large number of galaxy clusters out to a redshift of z ~ 0.5. We divided our sample into smaller subgroups based on their optical and radio properties. We find that FR I radio sources are more likely to be found in galaxy clusters than FR II sources. Further, we find that bent radio sources are more often found in galaxy clusters than non-bent radio sources. We also examined the environments around single-component radio sources and find that single-component radio sources are less likely to be associated with galaxy clusters than extended, multi-component radio sources. Bent, visually selected sources are found in clusters or rich groups ~78% of the time. Those without optical hosts in SDSS are likely associated with clusters at even higher redshifts, most with redshifts of z>0.7.

AB  - The goal of this work is to determine the nature of the relation between morphology and accretion mode in radio galaxies, including environmental parameters. The CoNFIG extended catalogue (improved by new KS-band identifications and estimated redshifts from UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), and spectral index measurements from new GMRT observations) is used to select a sub-sample of 206 radio galaxies with z <= 0.3 over a wide range of radio luminosity, which are morphology-classified using the Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classification of extended radio sources. For each galaxy, spectroscopic data are retrieved to determine the high/low excitation status of the source, related to its accretion mode. Environmental factors, such as the host galaxy luminosity and a richness factor, are also computed, generally using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. We find the following results: (1) at a given radio luminosity, the FR morphological split of sources is consistent with being the same for both accretion modes. This remains true if analysis is restricted to only rich or only poor environments. If confirmed with a larger sample, this would imply that extended radio morphology is independent of the accretion mode of the black hole, depending only on the power of the resultant jet, and its interactions with the larger-scale environment. (2) Excitation modes seem to be linked to the source environment, with high-excitation galaxies found almost exclusively in low-density environments while low-excitation galaxies occupy a wider range of densities; this result is independent of FR morphology, and is consistent with the different fuelling mechanisms expected for these excitation modes. (3) Independent of excitation mode, FRI sources are found to lie in higher density environments, on average, than FRII sources, consistent with FRI sources having their jets disrupted by a denser surrounding medium. However, there is a significant overlap in environment between the two classes, and no clear driving factor between the FRI and FRII sources is found even when combining radio luminosity, accretion mode, large-scale environment and host galaxy luminosity.

AB  - We use infrared spectroscopy and photometry to empirically define the intrinsic mid- to far-infrared spectral energy distribution (i.e. 6-100 mum SED) of thermal emission produced by typical (i.e. 2-10 keV luminosity, L2-10 keV˜ 1042-1044 erg s-1) active galactic nuclei (hereafter AGNs). The average infrared SED of typical AGNs is best described as a broken power law at ≲40 mu m that falls steeply at ≳40 mum (i.e. at far-infrared wavelengths). Despite this fall-off at long wavelengths, at least three of the 11 AGNs in our sample have demonstrated SEDs that are AGN dominated even at 60 mu m, demonstrating the importance of accounting for any AGN contribution when calculating galaxy infrared luminosities. We find that the average intrinsic AGN 6-100 mu m SED gets bluer with increasing X-ray luminosity - a trend seen both within our sample and also when we compare it with the intrinsic SEDs of more luminous quasars (i.e. L2-10 keV≳ 1044 erg s-1). The range of intrinsic AGN SEDs is more closely matched by clumpy, rather than continuous, torus models. Using our intrinsic AGN SEDs we define a set of correction factors to convert either monochromatic infrared or X-ray luminosities into total (i.e. 8-1000 mum) AGN infrared luminosities. We outline a procedure that uses our newly defined intrinsic AGN infrared SEDs, in conjunction with a selection of host-galaxy templates, to measure the AGN contribution to the infrared output of composite galaxies from photometry alone. We verify the accuracy of our SED-fitting procedure by comparing our results to two independent measures of AGN contribution: (1) 12-mum luminosities obtained from high spatial resolution observations of nearby galaxies and (2) the equivalent width of the 11.25-mum PAH feature. Our SED-fitting procedure opens up the possibility of measuring the intrinsic AGN luminosities for large numbers of galaxies with well-sampled infrared data (e.g. IRAS, ISO, Spitzer and Herschel). The intrinsic AGN infrared SEDs, host-galaxy templates and a procedure used to combine them to fit infrared photometry are available at

AB  - We revisit the relation between H2O maser detection rate and nuclear obscuration for a sample of 114 Seyfert galaxies drawn from the CfA, 12 mum, and IRAS F25/F60 catalogs. These sources have mid-infrared spectra from the Spitzer Space Telescope and we search for accompanying X-ray and [O III] 5007 Å fluxes from the literature. We use the strength of the [O IV] 25.9 mum emission line as a tracer of the intrinsic AGN strength. After the normalization by [O IV], the observed X-ray flux provides information about X-ray absorption. The distribution of X-ray/[O IV] flux ratios is significantly different for masers and non-masers: The maser detected Seyfert-2s (Sy 1.8-2.0) populate a distinct X-ray/[O IV] range, which is, on average, about a factor of four lower than the range of Seyfert-2 non-masers and about a factor of ten lower than the range of Seyfert-1s (Sy 1.0-1.5). Non-masers are almost equally distributed over the entire X-ray/[O IV] range. This provides evidence that high nuclear obscuration plays a crucial role in determining the probability of maser detection. Furthermore, after normalization with [O IV], we find a similar but weaker trend for the distribution of the maser detection rate with the absorption of the 7 mum dust continuum. This suggests that the obscuration of the 7 mum continuum occurs on larger spatial scales than that of the X-rays. Hence, in the AGN unified model, at moderate inclinations away from edge-on, the 7 mum dust absorption may occur without any proportionate X-ray absorption. The absorption of [O III] appears unrelated to maser detections. The failure to detect masers in obscured AGN is most likely due to insufficient observational sensitivity.

AB  - We investigate the 70 mum far-infrared-radio correlation (FRC) of star-forming galaxies in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) out to z > 2. We use 70 mum data from the Far-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (FIDEL), which comprises the most sensitive (~0.8 mJy rms) and extensive far-infrared deep field observations using MIPS on the Spitzer Space Telescope, and 1.4 GHz radio data (~8 muJy beam-1 rms) from the Very Large Array. In order to quantify the evolution of the FRC, we use both survival analysis and stacking techniques, which we find give similar results. We also calculate the FRC using total infrared luminosity and rest-frame radio luminosity, q TIR, and find that q TIR is constant (within 0.22) over the redshift range 0-2. We see no evidence for evolution in the FRC at 70 mum, which is surprising given the many factors that are expected to change this ratio at high redshifts.

AB  - We consider a configuration consisting of a wormhole filled by a perfect fluid. Such a model can be applied to describe stars as well as neutron stars with a nontrivial topology. The presence of a tunnel allows for motion of the fluid, including oscillations near the core of the system. Choosing the polytropic equation of state for the perfect fluid, we obtain static regular solutions. Based on these solutions, we consider small radial oscillations of the configuration and show that the solutions are stable with respect to linear perturbations in the external region.

AB  - Astrometric Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of maser sources in the Milky Way are used to map the spiral structure of our galaxy and to determine fundamental parameters such as the rotation velocity (Theta_0) and curve and the distance to the Galactic center (R_0). Here, we present an update on our first results, implementing a recent change in the knowledge about the Solar motion. It seems unavoidable that the IAU recommended values for R_0 and Theta_0 need a substantial revision. In particular the combination of 8.5 kpc and 220 km s-1, can be ruled out with high confidence. Combining the maser data with the distance to the Galactic center from stellar orbits and the proper motion of Sgr A* gives best values of R_0 = 8.3 $\pm$ 0.23 kpc and Theta_0 = 239 or 246 $\pm$ 7 km s-1, for Solar motions of V_&sun; = 12.23 and 5.25 km s-1, respectively. Finally, we give an outlook to future observations in the Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy (BeSSeL) survey.  Highlight talk Astronomische Gesellschaft 2010

AB  - We present Very Large Array observations of ammonia (NH3) (1,1), (2,2), and dicarbon sulfide (CCS) (21-10) emission toward the infrared dark cloud (IRDC) G19.30+0.07 at ~22 GHz. The NH3 emission closely follows the 8 mum extinction. The NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) lines provide diagnostics of the temperature and density structure within the IRDC, with typical rotation temperatures of ~10-20 K and NH3 column densities of ~1015 cm-2. The estimated total mass of G19.30+0.07 is ~1130 M sun. The cloud comprises four compact NH3 clumps of mass ~30-160 M sun. Two coincide with 24 mum emission, indicating heating by protostars, and show evidence of outflow in the NH3 emission. We report a water maser associated with a third clump; the fourth clump is apparently starless. A non-detection of 8.4 GHz emission suggests that the IRDC contains no bright H II regions and places a limit on the spectral type of an embedded zero-age main-sequence star to early-B or later. From the NH3 emission, we find that G19.30+0.07 is composed of three distinct velocity components or ``subclouds.'' One velocity component contains the two 24 mum sources and the starless clump, another contains the clump with the water maser, while the third velocity component is diffuse, with no significant high-density peaks. The spatial distribution of NH3 and CCS emission from G19.30+0.07 is highly anti-correlated, with the NH3 predominantly in the high-density clumps and the CCS tracing lower-density envelopes around those clumps. This spatial distribution is consistent with theories of evolution for chemically young low-mass cores, in which CCS has not yet been processed to other species and/or depleted in high-density regions.

AB  - We present measurements of 5-25 mum emission features of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with strong optical emission lines in a sample of nine cool-core clusters of galaxies observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. These systems provide a view of dusty molecular gas and star formation, surrounded by dense, X-ray-emitting intracluster gas. Past work has shown that BCGs in cool-core clusters may host powerful radio sources, luminous optical emission-line systems, and excess UV, while BCGs in other clusters never show this activity. In this sample, we detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), extremely luminous, rotationally excited molecular hydrogen line emission, forbidden line emission from ionized gas ([Ne II] and [Ne III]), and infrared continuum emission from warm dust and cool stars. We show here that these BCGs exhibit more luminous forbidden neon and H2 rotational line emission than star-forming galaxies with similar total infrared luminosities, as well as somewhat higher ratios of 70 mum/24 mum luminosities. Our analysis suggests that while star formation processes dominate the heating of the dust and PAHs, a heating process consistent with suprathermal electron heating from the hot gas, distinct from star formation, is heating the molecular gas and contributing to the heating of the ionized gas in the galaxies. The survival of PAHs and dust suggests that dusty gas is somehow shielded from significant interaction with the X-ray gas.

AB  - The study of the gas kinematic in the central 1.5 kpc × 1.5 kpc region of M 31 has revealed several surprises. The starting point of this investigation was the detection at the IRAM-30 m telescope of molecular gas with very large line splittings up to 260 km s-1 within the beam (~40 pc). In this region, which is known for its low gas content, we also detect an ionised gas outflow in the circumnuclear region (within 75 pc from the centre) extending to the whole area in X-ray. Relying on atomic, ionised, and molecular gas, we account for most observables with a scenario that assumes that a few hundreds Myr ago, M 31 underwent a frontal collision with M 32, which triggered some star-formation activity in the centre, and this collision explains the special configuration of M 31 with two rings observed at 0.7 kpc and 10 kpc. The inner disc (whose rotation is detected in HI and ionised gas ([NII])) has thus been tilted (inclination: 43 deg, PA: 70 deg) with respect to the main disc (inclination: 77 deg, PA: 35 deg). One of the CO velocity components is compatible with this inner disc, while the second one comes from a tilted ring-like material with 40 deg inclination and PA = -35 deg. The relic star formation estimatedby previous works to have occurred more than 100 Myr ago could have been triggered by the collisionand could be linked to the outflow detected in the ionised gas. Last, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the line splittings detected in CO centred on the systemic velocity with a relatively high spatial resolution (40 pc) cannot be accounted for by a possible weak bar that is roughly aligned along the minor axis. Although M 31 has a triaxial bulge, there are no bar indicators in the gas component (photometry, no strong skewness of the isovelocities, etc.).

AB  - We present the discovery of five new dwarf galaxies, Andromeda XXIII-XXVII, located in the outer halo of M31. These galaxies were discovered during the second year of data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS), a photometric survey of the M31/M33 subgroup conducted with the MegaPrime/MegaCam wide-field camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The current PAndAS survey now provides an almost complete panoramic view of the M31 halo out to an average projected radius of ~150 kpc. Here we present for the first time the metal-poor stellar density map for this whole region, not only as an illustration of the discovery space for satellite galaxies, but also as a birds-eye view of the ongoing assembly process of an L * disk galaxy. Four of the newly discovered satellites appear as well-defined spatial overdensities of stars lying on the expected locus of metal-poor (-2.5 < [Fe/H] < -1.3) red giant branch stars at the distance of M31. The fifth overdensity, And XXVII, is embedded in an extensive stream of such stars and is possibly the remnant of a strong tidal disruption event. Based on distance estimates from horizontal branch magnitudes, all five have metallicities typical of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ranging from [Fe/H] =-1.7 $\pm$ 0.2 to [Fe/H] =-1.9 $\pm$ 0.2 and absolute magnitudes ranging from MV = -7.1 $\pm$ 0.5 to MV = -10.2 $\pm$ 0.5. These five additional satellites bring the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in this region to 25 and continue the trend whereby the brighter dwarf spheroidal satellites of M31 generally have much larger half-light radii than their Milky Way counterparts. With an extended sample of M31 satellite galaxies, we also revisit the spatial distribution of this population and in particular we find that, within the current projected limits of the PAndAS survey, the surface density of satellites is essentially constant out to 150 kpc. This corresponds to a radial density distribution of satellites varying as r -1, a result seemingly in conflict with the predictions of cosmological simulations.  Based on observations obtained with the MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and CEA/DAPNIA, at CFHT which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.

AB  - A 45 deg2 radio continuum imaging campaign of the nearest radio galaxy, Centaurus A, is reported. Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Parkes 64 m radio telescope at 1.4 GHz, the spatial resolution of the resultant image is ~600 pc (~50''), resolving the gsim500 kpc giant radio lobes with approximately five times better physical resolution compared to any previous image, and making this the most detailed radio continuum image of any radio galaxy to date. In this paper, we present these new data and discuss briefly some of the most interesting morphological features that we have discovered in the images. The two giant outer lobes are highly structured and considerably distinct. The southern part of the giant northern lobe naturally extends out from the northern middle lobe with uniformly north-streaming emission. The well known northern loop is resolved into a series of semi-regular shells with a spacing of approximately 25 kpc. The northern part of the giant northern lobe also contains identifiable filaments and partial ring structures. As seen in previous single-dish images at lower angular resolution, the giant southern lobe is not physically connected to the core at radio wavelengths. Almost the entirety of the giant southern lobe is resolved into a largely chaotic and mottled structure which appears considerably different (morphologically) to the diffuse regularity of the northern lobe. We report the discovery of a vertex and a vortex near the western boundary of the southern lobe, two striking, high surface brightness features that are named based on their morphology and not their dynamics (which are presently unknown). The vortex and vertex are modeled as reaccelerated lobe emission due to shocks from the active galactic nucleus itself or from the passage of a dwarf elliptical galaxy through the lobe. Preliminary polarimetric and spectral index studies support a plasma reacceleration model and could explain the origin of the Faraday rotation structure detected in the southern lobe. In addition, there are a series of low surface brightness wisps detected around the edges of both the giant lobes.

AB  - Mass outflows driven by stars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a key element in many current models of galaxy evolution. They may produce the observed black-hole-galaxy mass relation and regulate and quench both star formation in the host galaxy and black hole accretion. However, observational evidence of such feedback processes through outflows of the bulk of the star-forming molecular gas is still scarce. Here we report the detection of massive molecular outflows, traced by the hydroxyl molecule (OH), in far-infrared spectra of ULIRGs obtained with Herschel-PACS as part of the SHINING key project. In some of these objects the (terminal) outflow velocities exceed 1000 km s-1, and their outflow rates (up to ~1200 M sun yr-1) are several times larger than their star formation rates. We compare the outflow signatures in different types of ULIRGs and in starburst galaxies to address the issue of the energy source (AGN or starburst) of these outflows. We report preliminary evidence that ULIRGs with a higher AGN luminosity (and higher AGN contribution to L IR) have higher terminal velocities and shorter gas depletion timescales. The outflows in the observed ULIRGs are able to expel the cold gas reservoirs from the centers of these objects within ~106-108 years.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.

AB  - We used the CLUMPY torus models and a Bayesian approach to fit the infrared spectral energy distributions and ground-based high angular resolution mid-infrared spectroscopy of 13 nearby Seyfert galaxies. This allowed us to put tight constraints on torus model parameters such as the viewing angle i, the radial thickness of the torus Y, the angular size of the cloud distribution sigmatorus, and the average number of clouds along radial equatorial rays N 0. We found that the viewing angle i is not the only parameter controlling the classification of a galaxy into type 1 or type 2. In principle, type 2s could be viewed at any viewing angle i as long as there is one cloud along the line of sight. A more relevant quantity for clumpy media is the probability for an active galactic nucleus (AGN) photon to escape unabsorbed. In our sample, type 1s have relatively high escape probabilities, P esc ~ 12%-44%, while type 2s, as expected, tend to have very low escape probabilities. Our fits also confirmed that the tori of Seyfert galaxies are compact with torus model radii in the range 1-6 pc. The scaling of the models to the data also provided the AGN bolometric luminosities L bol(AGN), which were found to be in good agreement with estimates from the literature. When we combined our sample of Seyfert galaxies with a sample of PG quasars from the literature to span a range of L bol(AGN) ~ 1043-1047 erg s-1, we found plausible evidence of the receding torus. That is, there is a tendency for the torus geometrical covering factor to be lower (f 2 ~ 0.1-0.3) at high AGN luminosities than at low AGN luminosities (f 2 ~ 0.9-1 at ~1043-1044 erg s-1). This is because at low AGN luminosities the tori appear to have wider angular sizes (larger sigmatorus) and more clouds along radial equatorial rays. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that this is due to contamination by extended dust structures not associated with the dusty torus at low AGN luminosities, since most of these in our sample are hosted in highly inclined galaxies.

AB  - We present observations of the molecular gas in the GN20 proto-cluster of galaxies at z = 4.05 using the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA). This group of galaxies is the ideal laboratory for studying the formation of massive galaxies via luminous, gas-rich starbursts within 1.6 Gyr of the big bang. We detect three galaxies in the proto-cluster in CO 2-1 emission, with gas masses (H2) between 1010 and 1011 × (alpha/0.8) M sun. The emission from the brightest source, GN20, is resolved with a size ~2'' and has a clear north-south velocity gradient, possibly indicating ordered rotation. The gas mass in GN20 is comparable to the stellar mass (1.3 × 1011 × (alpha/0.8) M sun and 2.3 × 1011 M sun, respectively), and the sum of gas plus stellar mass is comparable to the dynamical mass of the system (~3.4 × 1011[sin (i)/sin (45$\,^\circ$)]-2 M sun), within a 5 kpc radius. There is also evidence for a tidal tail extending another 2'' north of the galaxy with a narrow velocity dispersion. GN20 may be a massive, gas-rich disk that is gravitationally disturbed, but not completely disrupted. There is one Lyman-break galaxy (BD29079) in the GN20 proto-cluster with an optical spectroscopic redshift within our search volume, and we set a 3sigma limit to the molecular gas mass of this galaxy of 1.1 × 1010 × (alpha/0.8) M sun.

AB  - We present the deepest 100 to 500 mum far-infrared observations obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory as part of the GOODS-Herschel key program, and examine the infrared (IR) 3-500 mum spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies at 0 < z < 2.5, supplemented by a local reference sample from IRAS, ISO, Spitzer, and AKARI data. We determine the projected star formation densities of local galaxies from their radio and mid-IR continuum sizes. We find that the ratio of total IR luminosity to rest-frame 8 mum luminosity, IR8 (≡ LIRtot), follows a Gaussian distribution centered on IR8 = 4 (sigma = 1.6) and defines an IR main sequence for star-forming galaxies independent of redshift and luminosity. Outliers from this main sequence produce a tail skewed toward higher values of IR8. This minority population (<20%) is shown to consist of starbursts with compact projected star formation densities. IR8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of star formation from compact starbursts with high-IR8, high projected IR surface brightness (SigmaIR > 3 × 1010 L&sun; kpc-2) and a high specific star formation rate (i.e., starbursts). The rest-frame, UV-2700 Å size of these distant starbursts is typically half that of main sequence galaxies, supporting the correlation between star formation density and starburst activity that is measured for the local sample. Locally, luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies, (U)LIRGs (LIRtot), are systematically in the starburst mode, whereas most distant (U)LIRGs form stars in the ``normal'' main sequence mode. This confusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called ``mid-IR excess'' population of galaxies found at z > 1.5 by previous studies. Main sequence galaxies have strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission line features, a broad far-IR bump resulting from a combination of dust temperatures (Tdust ~ 15-50 K), and an effective Tdust ~ 31 K, as derived from the peak wavelength of their infrared SED. Galaxies in the starburst regime instead exhibit weak PAH equivalent widths and a sharper far-IR bump with an effective Tdust ~ 40 K. Finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far IR emission of X-ray active galactic nuclei (AGN) is predominantly produced by star formation and that candidate dusty AGNs with a power-law emission in the mid-IR systematically occur in compact, dusty starbursts. After correcting for the effect of starbursts on IR8, we identify new candidates for extremely obscured AGNs.

AB  - As part of a far-infrared (FIR) spectral scan with Herschel/PACS, we present the first detection of the hydroxyl radical (OH) towards the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR). Five OH (X 2Pi; nu = 0) rotational Lambda-doublets involving energy levels out to Eu/k ~ 511 K have been detected (at ~65, ~79, ~84, ~119 and ~163 mum). The total intensity of the OH lines is ∑ I(OH) ~= 5 × 10-4 erg s-1 cm-2 sr-1. The observed emission of rotationally excited OH lines is extended and correlates well with the high-J CO and CH+ J = 3-2 line emission (but apparently not with water vapour), pointing towards a common origin. Nonlocal, non-LTE radiative transfer models including excitation by the ambient FIR radiation field suggest that OH arises in a small filling factor component of warm (Tk ~= 160-220 K) and dense (nH ~= 106-7 cm-3) gas with source-averaged OH column densities of ≳ 1015 cm-2. High density and temperature photochemical models predict such enhanced OH columns at low depths (AV ≲ 1) and small spatial scales (~1015 cm), where OH formation is driven by gas-phase endothermic reactions of atomic oxygen with molecular hydrogen. We interpret the extended OH emission as coming from unresolved structures exposed to far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation near the Bar edge (photoevaporating clumps or filaments) and not from the lower density ``interclump'' medium. Photodissociation leads to OH/H2O abundance ratios (>1) much higher than those expected in equally warm regions without enhanced FUV radiation fields.

AB  - We examine the magnetic field in NGC 4214, a nearby irregular galaxy, using multi-wavelength radio continuum polarization data from the Very Large Array. We find that the global radio continuum spectrum shows signs that free-free absorption and/or synchrotron losses may be important. The 3 cm radio continuum morphology is similar to that of the Halpha  while the 20 cm emission is more diffuse. We estimate that 50% of the radio continuum emission in the center of the galaxy is thermal. Our estimate of the magnetic field strength is 30 $\pm$ 9.5 muG in the center and 10 $\pm$ 3 muG at the edges. We find that the hot gas, magnetic, and the gravitational pressures are all the same order of magnitude. Inside the central star-forming regions, we find that the thermal and turbulent pressures of the H II regions dominate the pressure balance. We do not detect any significant polarization on size scales greater than 200 pc. We place an upper limit of 8 muG on the uniform field strength in this galaxy. We suggest that the diffuse synchrotron region, seen to the north of the main body of emission at 20 cm, is elongated due to a uniform magnetic field with a maximum field strength of 7.6 muG. We find that, while the shear in NGC 4214 is comparable to that of the Milky Way, the supernova rate is half that of the Milky Way and suggest that the star formation episode in NGC 4214 needs additional time to build up enough turbulence to drive an alpha-omega dynamo.

AB  - Gravity Probe B, launched 20 April 2004, is a space experiment testing two fundamental predictions of Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR), the geodetic and frame-dragging effects, by means of cryogenic gyroscopes in Earth orbit. Data collection started 28 August 2004 and ended 14 August 2005. Analysis of the data from all four gyroscopes results in a geodetic drift rate of -6601.8$\pm$18.3mas/yr and a frame-dragging drift rate of -37.2$\pm$7.2mas/yr, to be compared with the GR predictions of -6606.1mas/yr and -39.2mas/yr, respectively (``mas'' is milliarcsecond; 1mas=4.848×10-9rad).

AB  - We present first results of the H2O Southern Galactic Plane Survey (HOPS), using the Mopra Radio Telescope with a broad-band backend and a beam size of about 2 arcmin. We have observed 100 deg2 of the southern Galactic plane at 12 mm (19.5-27.5 GHz), including spectral line emission from H2O masers, multiple metastable transitions of ammonia, cyanoacetylene, methanol and radio recombination lines. In this paper, we report on the characteristics of the survey and H2O maser emission. We find 540 H2O masers, of which 334 are new detections. The strongest maser is 3933 Jy and the weakest is 0.7 Jy, with 62 masers over 100 Jy. In 14 maser sites, the spread in the velocity of the H2O maser emission exceeds 100 km s-1. In one region, the H2O maser velocities are separated by 351.3 km s-1. The rms noise levels are typically between 1 and 2 Jy, with 95 per cent of the survey under 2 Jy. We estimate completeness limits of 98 per cent at around 8.4 Jy and 50 per cent at around 5.5 Jy. We estimate that there are between 800 and 1500 H2O masers in the Galaxy that are detectable in a survey with similar completeness limits to HOPS. We report possible masers in NH3 (11,9) and (8,6) emission towards G19.61-0.23 and in the NH3 (3,3) line towards G23.33-0.30.

AB  - Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) and Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) sources are classes of compact, powerful, extragalactic objects. These sources are thought to be the earliest stages in the evolution of radio galaxies, capturing the ignition (or, in some cases, re-ignition) of the active galactic nucleus. As well as serving as probes of the early stages of large-scale radio sources, these sources are good, stable, amplitude calibrators for radio telescopes. We present an unbiased flux density limited (>1.5 Jy at 2.7 GHz) catalogue of these objects in the Southern hemisphere, including tabulated data, radio spectra, and where available, optical images and measurements. The catalogue contains 26 sources, consisting of two new candidates and 15 known CSS sources, and nine known GPS sources. We present new Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) data on 10 of these 26 sources, and data on a further 42 sources which were excluded from our final sample. This bright sample will serve as a reference sample for comparison with subsequent faint (mJy level) samples of CSS and GPS candidates currently being compiled.

Around 105 files are from surveys of the sky, the remainder are observations of 775 individual pulsars and their corresponding calibration signals. Survey observations are included from the Parkes 70cm and the Swinburne Intermediate Latitude surveys. Individual pulsar observations are included from young pulsar timing projects, the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array and from the PULSE@Parkes outreach program. The data files and access methods are compatible with Virtual Observatory protocols. This paper describes the data currently stored in the archive and presents ways in which these data can be searched and downloaded.

AB  - We have undertaken a search for millimetre-waveband absorption (through the CO and HCO+ rotational transitions) in the host galaxies of reddened radio sources (z= 0.405-1.802). Despite the colour selection (optical-near-infrared colours of V-K≳ 5 in all but one source), no absorption was found in any of the eight quasars for which the background continuum flux was detected. On the basis of the previous (mostly intervening) H2 and OH detections, the limits reached here and in some previous surveys should be deep enough to detect molecular absorption according to their V-K colours. However, our survey makes the assumption that the reddening is associated with dust close to the emission redshift of the quasar and that the narrow millimetre component of this emission is intercepted by the compact molecular cores. By using the known millimetre absorbers to define the colour depth and comparing this with the ultraviolet luminosities of the sources, we find that, even if these assumptions are valid, only 12 of the 40 objects (mainly from this work) are potentially detectable. This is assuming an excitation temperature of Tx= 10 K at z= 0, with the number decreasing with increasing temperatures (to zero detectable at Tx≳ 100 K).

AB  - The ongoing Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey is a wide-area, extragalactic HI-line survey conducted at the Arecibo Observatory. Sources have so far been extracted over ~3000 deg2 of sky (40% of its final area), resulting in the largest HI-selected sample to date. We measure the space density of HI-bearing galaxies as a function of their observed velocity width (uncorrected for inclination) down to w = 20 km s-1, a factor of two lower than the previous generation HI Parkes All-Sky Survey. We confirm previous results that indicate a substantial discrepancy between the observational distribution and the theoretical one expected in a cold dark matter (CDM) universe, at low widths. In particular, a comparison with synthetic galaxy samples populating state-of-the-art CDM simulations imply a factor of ~8 difference in the abundance of galaxies with w = 50 km s-1 (increasing to a factor of ~100 when extrapolated to the ALFALFA limit of w = 20 km s-1). We furthermore identify possible solutions, including a keV warm dark matter scenario and the fact that HI disks in low-mass galaxies are usually not extended enough to probe the full amplitude of the galactic rotation curve. In this latter case, we can statistically infer the relationship between the measured HI rotational velocity of a galaxy and the mass of its host CDM halo. Observational verification of the presented relationship at low velocities would provide an important test of the validity of the established dark matter model.

AB  - We present a pilot survey of 21 lines of sight toward ultracompact H II (UCH II) regions and three toward continuum-free lines of sight in the formaldehyde (H2CO) 110-111 (6 cm) and 211-212 (2 cm) transitions, using the H2CO centimeter lines as a molecular gas densitometer. Using Arecibo and Green Bank beam-matched observations, we measure the density of 51 detected H2CO line pairs and present upper limits on density for an additional 24 detected 110-111 lines. We analyze the systematic uncertainties in the H2CO densitometer, achieving H2 density measurements with accuracies ~0.1-0.3 dex. The densities measured are not correlated with distance, implying that it is possible to make accurate density measurements throughout the galaxy without a distance bias. We confirm that UCH II regions are associated with, and possibly embedded in, gas at densities n(H2) >~ 105 cm-3. The densities measured in line-of-sight molecular clouds suggest that they consist of low volume filling factor (f ~ 10-2) gas at high (n(H2) > 104 cm-3) density, which is inconsistent with purely supersonic turbulence and requires high-density clumping greater than typically observed in gravoturbulent simulations. We observe complex line morphologies that indicate density variations with velocity around UCH II regions, and we classify a subset of the UCH II molecular envelopes as collapsing or expanding. We compare these measurements to Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey 1.1 mm observations, and note that most UCH II regions have 1.1 mm emission consisting of significant (5%-70%) free-free emission and are therefore not necessarily dominated by optically thin dust emission as is often assumed when computing clump masses. A comparison of our data with the Mangum et al. starburst sample shows that the area filling factor of dense (n(H2) ~ 105 cm-3) molecular gas in typical starburst galaxies is <~ 0.01, but in extreme starburst galaxies like Arp 220, is ~0.1, suggesting that Arp 220 is physically similar to an oversized UCH II region.

AB  - The methanol molecule CH3OH has a complex microwave spectrum with a large number of very strong lines. This spectrum includes purely rotational transitions as well as transitions with contributions of the internal degree of freedom associated with the hindered rotation of the OH group. The latter takes place due to the tunneling of hydrogen through the potential barriers between three equivalent potential minima. Such transitions are highly sensitive to changes in the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu = m e/m p, and have different responses to mu-variations. The highest sensitivity is found for the mixed rotation-tunneling transitions at low frequencies. Observing methanol lines provides more stringent limits on the hypothetical variation of mu than ammonia observation with the same velocity resolution. We show that the best-quality radio astronomical data on methanol maser lines constrain the variability of mu in the Milky Way at the level of |Deltamu/mu| < 28 × 10-9 (1sigma) which is in line with the previously obtained ammonia result, |Deltamu/mu| < 29 × 10-9 (1sigma). This estimate can be further improved if the rest frequencies of the CH3OH microwave lines will be measured more accurately.

AB  - External occulters, otherwise known as starshades, have been proposed as a solution to one of the highest priority yet technically vexing problems facing astrophysics---the direct imaging and characterization of terrestrial planets around other stars. New apodization functions, developed over the past few years, now enable starshades of just a few tens of meters diameter to occult central stars so efficiently that the orbiting exoplanets can be revealed and other high-contrast imaging challenges addressed. In this paper, an analytic approach to the analysis of these apodization functions is presented. It is used to develop a tolerance analysis suitable for use in designing practical starshades. The results provide a mathematical basis for understanding starshades and a quantitative approach to setting tolerances.

AB  - Despite the great promise of machine-learning algorithms to classify and predict astrophysical parameters for the vast numbers of astrophysical sources and transients observed in large-scale surveys, the peculiarities of the training data often manifest as strongly biased predictions on the data of interest. Typically, training sets are derived from historical surveys of brighter, more nearby objects than those from more extensive, deeper surveys (testing data). This sample selection bias can cause catastrophic errors in predictions on the testing data because (1) standard assumptions for machine-learned model selection procedures break down and (2) dense regions of testing space might be completely devoid of training data. We explore possible remedies to sample selection bias, including importance weighting, co-training, and active learning (AL). We argue that AL---where the data whose inclusion in the training set would most improve predictions on the testing set are queried for manual follow-up---is an effective approach and is appropriate for many astronomical applications. For a variable star classification problem on a well-studied set of stars from Hipparcos and Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, AL is the optimal method in terms of error rate on the testing data, beating the off-the-shelf classifier by 3.4% and the other proposed methods by at least 3.0%. To aid with manual labeling of variable stars, we developed a Web interface which allows for easy light curve visualization and querying of external databases. Finally, we apply AL to classify variable stars in the All Sky Automated Survey, finding dramatic improvement in our agreement with the ASAS Catalog of Variable Stars, from 65.5% to 79.5%, and a significant increase in the classifier's average confidence for the testing set, from 14.6% to 42.9%, after a few AL iterations.

AB  - We report a detection of the excited 220-211 rotational transition of para-H2O in APM 08279+5255 using the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. At z = 3.91, this is the highest-redshift detection of interstellar water to date. From large velocity gradient modeling, we conclude that this transition is predominantly radiatively pumped and on its own does not provide a good estimate of the water abundance. However, additional water transitions are predicted to be detectable in this source, which would lead to an improved excitation model. We also present a sensitive upper limit for the hydrogen fluoride (HF) J = 1-0 absorption toward APM 08279+5255. While the face-on geometry of this source is not favorable for absorption studies, the lack of HF absorption is still puzzling and may be indicative of a lower fluorine abundance at z = 3.91 compared with the Galactic interstellar medium.

AB  - We present Herschel Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver Fourier Transform Spectrometer (Herschel SPIRE-FTS) observations of Arp 220, a nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxy. The FTS provides continuous spectral coverage from 190 to 670 mum, a wavelength region that is either very difficult to observe or completely inaccessible from the ground. The spectrum provides a good measurement of the continuum and detection of several molecular and atomic species. We detect luminous CO (J = 4-3 to 13-12) and water rotational transitions with comparable total luminosity ~2 × 108 L &sun; very high-J transitions of HCN (J = 12-11 to 17-16) in absorption; strong absorption features of rare species such as OH+, H2O+, and HF; and atomic lines of [C I] and [N II]. The modeling of the continuum shows that the dust is warm, with T = 66 K, and has an unusually large optical depth, with taudust ~ 5 at 100 mum. The total far-infrared luminosity of Arp 220 is L FIR ~ 2 × 1012 L &sun;. Non-LTE modeling of the extinction corrected CO rotational transitions shows that the spectral line energy distribution of CO is fit well by two temperature components: cold molecular gas at T ~ 50 K and warm molecular gas at T ~ 1350+280  - 100 K (the inferred temperatures are much lower if CO line fluxes are not corrected for dust extinction). These two components are not in pressure equilibrium. The mass of the warm gas is 10% of the cold gas, but it dominates the CO luminosity. The ratio of total CO luminosity to the total FIR luminosity is L CO/L FIR ~ 10-4 (the most luminous lines, such as J = 6-5, have L CO, J = 6-5/L FIR ~ 10-5). The temperature of the warm gas is in excellent agreement with the observations of H2 rotational lines. At 1350 K, H2 dominates the cooling (~20 L &sun; M -1 &sun;) in the interstellar medium compared to CO (~0.4 L &sun; M -1 &sun;). We have ruled out photodissociation regions, X-ray-dominated regions, and cosmic rays as likely sources of excitation of this warm molecular gas, and found that only a non-ionizing source can heat this gas; the mechanical energy from supernovae and stellar winds is able to satisfy the large energy budget of ~20 L &sun; M -1 &sun;. Analysis of the very high-J lines of HCN strongly indicates that they are solely populated by infrared pumping of photons at 14 mum. This mechanism requires an intense radiation field with T > 350 K. We detect a massive molecular outflow in Arp 220 from the analysis of strong P Cygni line profiles observed in OH+, H2O+, and H2O. The outflow has a mass >~ 107 M &sun; and is bound to the nuclei with velocity <~ 250 km s-1. The large column densities observed for these molecular ions strongly favor the existence of an X-ray luminous AGN (1044 erg s-1) in Arp 220.

AB  - The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) grew up with and has been riding the waves of the Information Age, closely monitoring and anticipating the needs of its end-users. By now, all professional astronomers are using the ADS on a daily basis, and a substantial fraction have been using it for their entire professional career. In addition to being an indispensable tool for professional scientists, the ADS also moved into the public domain, as a tool for science education. In this paper we will highlight and discuss some aspects indicative of the impact the ADS has had on research and the access to scholarly publications.

AB  - The classical diagrams of radio loudness and jet power as a function of mass and accretion rate of the central spacetime singularity in active galactic nuclei are reanalyzed by including the data of the recently discovered powerful relativistic jets in Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies. The results are studied in the light of the known theories of relativistic jets, indicating that, although the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is sufficient to explain the power radiated by BL Lac Objects, it fails to completely account for the power from quasars and Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies. This favors the scenario outlined by Cavaliere & D'Elia of a composite jet, with a magnetospheric core plus a hydromagnetic component emerging when the accretion power increases and the disk becomes radiation-pressure dominated. A comparison with Galactic compact objects is also made, finding some striking similarities, indicating that since neutron stars are low-mass jet systems analogous to black holes, Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies are low-mass counterparts of blazars.

AB  - We construct a sample of 3516 radio-loud host galaxies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the optical Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm. These have 1.4-GHz luminosities in the range 1023-1025 W Hz-1, span redshifts 0.02 < z < 0.18, are brighter than r*petro < 17.77 mag and are constrained to 'early-type' morphology in colour space (u*-r* > 2.22 mag). Optical emission line ratios (at >3sigma) are used to remove type 1 AGN and star-forming galaxies from the radio sample using Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagnostics. For comparison, we select a sample of 35 160 radio-quiet galaxies with the same r*-band magnitude-redshift distribution as the radio sample. We also create comparison radio and control samples derived by adding the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) to quantify the effect of completeness on our results.  We investigate the effective radii of the surface brightness profiles in the SDSS r and u bands in order to quantify any excess of blue colour in the inner region of radio galaxies. We define a ratio R=re(r)/re(u) and use maximum likelihood analysis to compare the average value of R and its intrinsic dispersion between both samples. R is larger for the radio-loud AGN sample as compared to its control counterpart, and we conclude that the two samples are not drawn from the same population at >99 per cent significance. Given that star formation proceeds over a longer time than radio activity, the difference suggests that a subset of galaxies has the predisposition to become radio loud. We discuss host galaxy features that cause the presence of a radio-loud AGN to increase the scale size of a galaxy in red relative to blue light, including excess central blue emission, point-like blue emission from the AGN itself and/or diffuse red emission. We favour an explanation that arises from the stellar rather than the AGN light.

AB  - Molecular hydrogen transitions in quasar spectra can be used to constrain variation in the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu≡ mp/me, at high redshifts (z ≳ 2). We present here an analysis of a new spectrum of the quasar Q0528-250, obtained on Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES), and analyse the well-known H2 absorber at z = 2.811 in this spectrum. For the first time we detect deuterated molecular hydrogen (HD) in this system with a column density of log10(N/cm-2) = 13.27 $\pm$ 0.07; HD is sensitive to variation in mu, and so we include it in our analysis. Using 76 H2 and seven HD transitions we constrain variation in mu from the current laboratory value to be Deltamu/mu= (0.3 $\pm$ 3.2stat$\pm$ 1.9sys) × 10-6, which is consistent with no cosmological variation in mu, as well as with previous results from other H2/HD absorbers. The main sources of systematic uncertainty relate to accurate wavelength calibration of the spectra and the re-dispersion of multiple telescope exposures on to the one pixel grid.

AB  - We present the results of our study of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a sample of 10 low- to intermediate-synchrotron-peaked blazars. We investigate some of the physical parameters most likely responsible for the observed short-term variations in blazars. To do so, we focus on the study of changes in the SEDs of blazars corresponding to changes in their respective optical fluxes. We model the observed spectra of blazars from radio to optical frequencies using a synchrotron model that entails a log-parabolic distribution of electron energies. A significant correlation among the two fitted spectral parameters (a, b) of log-parabolic curves and a negative trend among the peak frequency and spectral curvature parameter, b, emphasize that the SEDs of blazars are fitted well by log-parabolic curves. On considering each model parameter that could be responsible for changes in the observed SEDs of these blazars, we find that changes in the jet Doppler factors are most important.

AB  - Context. The compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are small (< 1 kiloparsec) and powerful extragalactic radio sources showing emission on both sides of an active galactic nucleus and no signs of strong relativistic beaming. They may be young radio sources, progenitors of large FR II radio galaxies.  Aims: We aim to study the statistical properties of CSOs by constructing and investigating a new large sample of CSO candidates on the basis of dual-frequency, parsec-scale morphology.  Methods: For the candidate selection we utilized VLBI data for 4170 extragalactic objects obtained simultaneously at 2.3 and 8.6 GHz (S and X band) within the VLBA Calibrator Survey 1-6 and the Research and Development - VLBA projects. Properties of their broad-band radio spectra were characterized by using RATAN-600 observations. Numerical modeling was applied in an attempt to explain the observed effects.  Results: A sample of 64 candidate CSOs is identified. The median two-point S-X band spectral index of parsec-scale hotspots is found to be - 0.52; with the median brightness temperature ~ 109 K at X band. Statistical analysis reveals a systematic difference between positions of brightest CSO components (associated with hotspots) measured in the S and X bands. The distance between these components is found to be on average 0.32 $\pm$ 0.06 mas greater at 8.6 GHz than at 2.3 GHz.  Conclusions: This difference in distances cannot be explained by different resolutions at the S and X bands. It is a manifestation of spectral index gradients across CSO components, which may potentially provide important physical information about them. Despite our detailed numerical modeling of a CSO hotspot, the model was not able to reproduce the magnitude of the observed positional difference. A more detailed modeling may shed light on the origin of the effect. Multifrequency follow-up VLBI observations of the selected sample are needed to confirm and study newly identified CSOs from the list presented here.

AB  - We perform two-dimensional, point-spread-function-convolved, bulge+disk decompositions in the g and r bandpasses on a sample of 1,123,718 galaxies from the Legacy area of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Seven. Four different decomposition procedures are investigated which make improvements to sky background determinations and object deblending over the standard SDSS procedures that lead to more robust structural parameters and integrated galaxy magnitudes and colors, especially in crowded environments. We use a set of science-based quality assurance metrics, namely, the disk luminosity-size relation, the galaxy color-magnitude diagram, and the galaxy central (fiber) colors to show the robustness of our structural parameters. The best procedure utilizes simultaneous, two-bandpass decompositions. Bulge and disk photometric errors remain below 0.1 mag down to bulge and disk magnitudes of g ~= 19 and r ~= 18.5. We also use and compare three different galaxy fitting models: a pure Sérsic model, an nb = 4 bulge + disk model, and a Sérsic (free nb ) bulge + disk model. The most appropriate model for a given galaxy is determined by the F-test probability. All three catalogs of measured structural parameters, rest-frame magnitudes, and colors are publicly released here. These catalogs should provide an extensive comparison set for a wide range of observational and theoretical studies of galaxies.

AB  - We have produced the next generation of quasar spectral energy distributions (SEDs), essentially updating the work of Elvis et al. by using high-quality data obtained with several space- and ground-based telescopes, including NASA's Great Observatories. We present an atlas of SEDs of 85 optically bright, non-blazar quasars over the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to X-rays. The heterogeneous sample includes 27 radio-quiet and 58 radio-loud quasars. Most objects have quasi-simultaneous ultraviolet-optical spectroscopic data, supplemented with some far-ultraviolet spectra, and more than half also have Spitzer mid-infrared Infrared Spectrograph spectra. The X-ray spectral parameters are collected from the literature where available. The radio, far-infrared, and near-infrared photometric data are also obtained from either the literature or new observations. We construct composite SEDs for radio-loud and radio-quiet objects and compare these to those of Elvis et al., finding that ours have similar overall shapes, but our improved spectral resolution reveals more detailed features, especially in the mid- and near-infrared.

AB  - EMU is a wide-field radio continuum survey planned for the new Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope. The primary goal of EMU is to make a deep (rms ~10muJy/beam) radio continuum survey of the entire Southern sky at 1.3GHz, extending as far North as +30$\,^\circ$ declination, with a resolution of 10arcsec. EMU is expected to detect and catalogue about 70million galaxies, including typical star-forming galaxies up to z~1, powerful starbursts to even greater redshifts, and active galactic nuclei to the edge of the visible Universe. It will undoubtedly discover new classes of object. This paper defines the science goals and parameters of the survey, and describes the development of techniques necessary to maximise the science return from EMU.

AB  - The discovery of high-energy (E > 100 MeV) gamma rays from Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies (gamma-NLS1s) has confirmed the presence of powerful relativistic jets in this class of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Although the jet emission is similar to that of blazars and radio galaxies, gamma-NLS1s have some striking differences: relatively small masses (106-8 M&sun;), high accretion rates (0.1-1 times the Eddington limit) and are generally hosted by spiral galaxies. It is now possible to study a rather unexplored range of mass and accretion rates of AGN with relativistic jets. Specifically, in this work I present some results obtained by comparing a sample of blazars and gamma-NLS1s with another sample of Galactic binaries with relativistic jets (stellar mass black holes and neutron stars).

Early studies were limited by inhomogeneous QSO samples, inadequate sensitivity to probe the radio-quiet population, and degeneracy between redshift and luminosity for flux-density-limited samples. Our new 6 GHz Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) observations allow us for the first time to obtain nearly complete (97%) radio detections in a volume-limited color-selected sample of 179 QSOs more luminous than Mi = -23 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release Seven in the narrow redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.3. The dramatic improvement in radio continuum sensitivity made possible with the new EVLA allows us, in 35 minutes of integration, to detect sources as faint as 20 muJy, or log [L 6 GHz(W Hz-1)] ≈ 21.5 at z = 0.25, well below the radio luminosity, log [L 6(W Hz-1)] ≈ 22.5, that separates star-forming galaxies from radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) driven by accretion onto a supermassive black hole. We calculate the radio luminosity function (RLF) for these QSOs using three constraints: (1) EVLA 6 GHz observations for log [L 6(W Hz-1)] < 23.5, (2) NRAO-VLA Sky Survey observations for log [L 6(W Hz-1)] > 23.5, and (3) the total number of SDSS QSOs in our volume-limited sample. We show that the RLF can be explained as a superposition of two populations, dominated by AGNs at the bright end and star formation in the QSO host galaxies at the faint end.

AB  - F00183-7111 is one of the most extreme ultraluminous infrared galaxies known, with a bolometric luminosity of 9 × 1012 L&sun;. Here we present a very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)_ image which shows a compact core-jet active galactic nucleus (AGN) in its core, with a radio luminosity (L2.3 GHz= 6 × 1025 W Hz-1) typical of powerful radio galaxies. Although already radio loud, the quasar jets are only 1.7 kpc long, boring through the dense gas and starburst activity that confine them. This source therefore appears to be powered by a combination of a compact radio-loud AGN surrounded by vigorous starburst activity.

AB  - Context. The nearly edge-on galaxy NGC 4945 is one of the closest galaxies where an AGN and starburst coexist, and is one of the brightest sources at 100 keV. Near and mid-infrared spectroscopy have shown very strong obscuration of its central region, rivaled only in strength by some of the most deeply obscured ULIRGs.  Aims: We determine the spatial distribution of ISM emission features in the central 426 × 426 pc2 of NGC 4945.  Methods: We mapped the central region of NGC 4945 in three of the four Spitzer-IRS modules (SH, SL and LL). In particular, we produced maps of the flux distribution of the starburst tracers [Ne II], [Ne III], [S III] and [S IV] at 12.81, 15.56, 18.71, and 10.51 mum, respectively, and a map of the AGN narrow-line region tracer [Ne V] at 14.32 mum. In addition, we mapped the S(1), S(2), and S(3) pure rotational lines of H2, which trace the distribution of warm molecular hydrogen. Finally, we obtained an extinction map (AV) based on the apparent strength of the 9.7 mum silicate absorption feature.  Results: At a spatial resolution of ~5'', our extinction map traces the contours of the starburst ring. The highest extinction is, however, found at the nucleus, where we measure AV(9.85 mum) ≈ 60. Within the uncertainty of the astrometry, all emission lines are found to peak on the nucleus, except for the warm molecular hydrogen emission, which shows a maximum 60-100 pc NW of the nucleus. We favor a scenario in which the emission of the lower H2 0-0 S(1) and S(2) rotational lines originate mainly in an unobscured extranuclear component associated with the super-wind cone observed in the HST NICMOS map of the H2 1-0 S(1) vibrational line. For the [Ne V] emission we infer an attenuation of a factor 12-160 (AV = 55-112) based on a comparison of the ratio of our [Ne V] flux and the absorption-corrected 14-195 keV Swift-BAT flux to the average [Ne V]/BAT ratio for Seyfert 1 nuclei. The high attenuation indicates that [Ne V] and [O IV] cannot be used as extinction-free tracers of AGN power in galaxies with deeply buried nuclei.  We dedicate this paper to the memory of our esteemed colleague and advisor, Alan Moorwood (1945-2011), who pioneered the infrared spectroscopic study of NGC 4945. This work is based on observations obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under NASA contract 1407.

AB  - We present evidence that the incidence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the distribution of their accretion rates do not depend on the stellar masses of their host galaxies, contrary to previous studies. We use hard (2-10 keV) X-ray data from three extragalactic fields (XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and ELAIS-S1) with redshifts from the Prism Multi-object Survey to identify 242 AGNs with L 2-10 keV = 1042-44 erg s-1 within a parent sample of ~25,000 galaxies at 0.2 < z < 1.0 over ~3.4 deg2 and to i ~ 23. We find that although the fraction of galaxies hosting an AGN at fixed X-ray luminosity rises strongly with stellar mass, the distribution of X-ray luminosities is independent of mass. Furthermore, we show that the probability that a galaxy will host an AGN can be defined by a universal Eddington ratio distribution that is independent of the host galaxy stellar mass and has a power-law shape with slope -0.65. These results demonstrate that AGNs are prevalent at all stellar masses in the range 9.5 and that the same physical processes regulate AGN activity in all galaxies in this stellar mass range. While a higher AGN fraction may be observed in massive galaxies, this is a selection effect related to the underlying Eddington ratio distribution. We also find that the AGN fraction drops rapidly between z ~ 1 and the present day and is moderately enhanced (factor ~2) in galaxies with blue or green optical colors. Consequently, while AGN activity and star formation appear to be globally correlated, we do not find evidence that the presence of an AGN is related to the quenching of star formation or the color transformation of galaxies.

AB  - Context. Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies are a class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that have all the properties of type 1 Seyfert galaxies but show peculiar characteristics, including the narrowest Balmer lines, strongest Fe II emission, and extreme properties in the X-rays. Line and continuum radio observations provide an optimal tool to access the (often) optically obscured innermost regions of AGN and reveal the kinematics of the gas around their central engines.  Aims: We investigate the interplay between the peculiar NLS1 class of AGN and the maser phenomenon, to help us understand the nature of the maser emission in some NLS1s where water maser emission has been detected.  Methods: We observed a sample of NLS1 galaxies with the Green Bank Telescope in a search for water maser emission at 22 GHz. We also reduced and analysed archival Green Bank Telescope and Very Large Array data and produced 22-GHz spectra for the five NLS1 galaxies with detected maser emission. In particular, we imaged the maser and nuclear radio continuum of NGC 5506 at subarcsec scales with the Very Large Array.  Results: We discovered maser emission in two NLS1 galaxies: IGR J16385-2057, and IRAS 03450+0055. In addition to the three previously known maser detections in the NLS1s Mrk 766, NGC 4051, and NGC 5506, this yields a water maser detection rate in NLS1 galaxies of ~7% (5/71). This value rises significantly to ~21% (5/24) when considering only NLS1 galaxies at recessional velocities less than 10 000 km s-1. For NGC 4051 and NGC 5506, we find that the water maser emission is located within 5 and 12 pc, respectively, of nuclear radio continuum knots, which are interpreted as core-jet structures.  Conclusions: The water maser detection rate in NLS1s is surprisingly high, much higher than the detection rate obtained for type 1 AGN and similar to those in Seyfert 2 and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. The masers in NGC 4051 and NGC 5506 are nuclear and associated with the AGN, either with an accretion disk, a radio jet, or a nuclear outflow. The apparent lack of high-velocity maser features and evidence, recently reported, of radiative outflows and radio jets in the host galaxies seems to favour interpretation as a jet or an outflow. A similar association is also seemingly true for the maser in Mrk 766, IGR J16385-2057, and IRAS 03450+0055, although, in these cases, without radio interferometric measurements we cannot rule out an off-nuclear origin of the emission.

AB  - We investigate the Fermi Large Area Telescope gamma-ray and 15 GHz Very Long Baseline Array radio properties of a joint gamma-ray and radio-selected sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) obtained during the first 11 months of the Fermi mission (2008 August 4-2009 July 5). Our sample contains the brightest 173 AGNs in these bands above declination -30$\,^\circ$ during this period, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray to radio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. The latter quantity spans at least 4 orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range of spectral energy distribution (SED) parameters in the bright blazar population. The BL Lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasing gamma-ray loudness with synchrotron SED peak frequency, suggesting a universal SED shape for objects of this class. The synchrotron self-Compton model is favored for the gamma-ray emission in these BL Lac objects over external seed photon models, since the latter predict a dependence of Compton dominance on Doppler factor that would destroy any observed synchrotron SED-peak-gamma-ray-loudness correlation. The high-synchrotron peaked (HSP) BL Lac objects are distinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, and none display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarization levels. No equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) in our sample. Given the association of such properties with relativistic beaming, we suggest that the HSP BL Lac objects have generally lower Doppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked BL Lac objects or FSRQs in our sample.

AB  - Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues created from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we examine in detail the specific star formation rate (SSFR) distribution of satellite galaxies and its dependence on stellar mass, host halo mass and halo-centric radius. All galaxies, regardless of central satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal SSFR distribution, with a strong break at SSFR ≈ 10-11 yr-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no regime is there ever an excess of galaxies in the 'green valley'. Satellite galaxies are simply more likely to lie on the quenched ('red sequence') side of the SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar mass. An enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups with halo masses down to 3 × 1011 M&sun; and increases strongly with halo mass and towards halo centre. We find no detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond ˜2 Rvir around massive clusters once these galaxies have been decomposed into centrals and satellites. These trends imply that (1) galaxies experience no significant environmental effects until they cross within ˜Rvir of a more massive host halo; (2) after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve in the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyr; and (3) once begun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. These results place strong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as we will discuss further in companion papers.

AB  - Aims: We performed observations with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope to measure flux densities and polarised emission of sources selected from the ``Deep X-ray Radio Blazar Survey'' (DXRBS) to better define their spectral index behaviour in the radio band, with the aim to construct a homogeneous sample of blazars.  Methods: Sources were observed at four different frequencies with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope. We complemented these measurements with flux density data at 1.4 GHz derived from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS).  Results: The spectral indices of a sample of faint blazars were computed making use of almost simultaneous measurements. Sixty-six percent of the sources can be classified as ``bona fide'' blazars. Seven objects show a clearly inverted spectral index. Seventeen sources previously classified as flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) are actually steep spectrum radio quasars (SSRQ). The flux densities obtained with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope at 5 GHz are compared with the flux densities listed in the Green Bank (GB6) survey and in the Parkes-MIT-NRAO (PMN) catalogue. About 43% of the sources in our sample exhibit flux density variations on temporal scales of 19 or 22 years.  Conclusions: We confirm that 75 out of 103 sources of the DXRBS are indeed FSRQs. Twenty-seven sources show a spectral index steeper than -0.5 and should be classified as SSRQs. Polarised emission was detected for 36 sources at 4.85 GHz. The median value of the percentage of polarised emission is (5.8 $\pm$ 0.9)%. Five sources show rotation measure (RM) values >200 rad m-2.

AB  - We cross match the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm surveys with three large photometric catalogues of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) to define radio-loud samples. These have median redshifts 0.35, 0.55 and 0.68 and, by matching rest-frame optical and radio properties, we construct uniform samples across the three surveys. This paper is concerned with the clustering properties of these samples derived from the angular correlation function. The primary aim is to characterize any evolution in the clustering amplitude of radio galaxies below z˜ 0.68.  We find no evidence for evolution in the large-scale (˜1-50 h-1 Mpc) clustering amplitude. Our radio galaxy autocorrelations are consistent with previous findings indicating little-to-no evolution in the redshift range 0.68-0 (˜6 Gyr of time). We also cross-correlate radio galaxies with the parent LRG samples to increase the precision of our results and again find no evidence for evolution in comoving coordinates. Our results are inconsistent with a long-lived model for the clustering evolution that assumes radio sources randomly sample the LRG population. A model where the halo mass is constant with redshift is consistent with the data. This is similar to quasi-stellar object (QSOs) that have clustering amplitudes consistent with a single halo mass at all redshifts. Given that the brightest radio sources show stronger evolution in space density compared to fainter radio sources we restrict our samples to include only objects with L > 1026 W Hz-1 and repeat the analysis. Again we find no evidence for evolution in the comoving correlation amplitude. These radio sources appear to inhabit the same mass haloes as fainter radio galaxies (˜9 × 1013 h-1 M&sun;). These haloes are ˜twice as massive as those of the general LRG population (˜4 × 1013 h-1 M&sun;) and ˜30 times as massive as optical AGN/QSOs (˜3 × 1012 h-1 M&sun;).

AB  - We present results from the second part of our analysis of the extended mid-infrared (MIR) emission of the GOALS sample based on 5-14 mum low-resolution spectra obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph on Spitzer. We calculate the fraction of extended emission (FEE) as a function of wavelength for all galaxies in the sample, FEElambda, defined as the fraction of the emission that originates outside of the unresolved central component of a source, and spatially separate the MIR spectrum of a galaxy into its nuclear and extended components. We find that the [Ne II]12.81 mum emission line is as compact as the hot dust MIR continuum, while the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission is more extended. In addition, the 6.2 and 7.7 mum PAH emission is more compact than that of the 11.3 mum PAH, which is consistent with the formers being enhanced in a more ionized medium. The presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or a powerful nuclear starburst increases the compactness and the luminosity surface density of the hot dust MIR continuum, but has a negligible effect on the spatial extent of the PAH emission on kpc-scales. Furthermore, it appears that both processes, AGN and/or nuclear starburst, are indistinguishable in terms of how they modify the integrated PAH-to-continuum ratio of the FEE in (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies ((U)LIRGs). Globally, the 5-14 mum spectra of the extended emission component are homogeneous for all galaxies in the GOALS sample. This suggests that, independently of the spatial distribution of the various MIR features, the physical properties of star formation occurring at distances farther than 1.5 kpc from the nuclei of (U)LIRGs are very similar, resembling local star-forming galaxies with L IR < 1011 L sun, as well as star-formation-dominated ULIRGs at z ~ 2. In contrast, the MIR spectra of the nuclear component of local ULIRGs and LIRGs are very diverse. These results imply that the observed variety of the integrated MIR properties of local (U)LIRGs arise, on average, only from the processes that are taking place in their cores.

AB  - We describe global, 3D, time-dependent, non-radiative, general-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accreting black holes (BHs). The simulations are designed to transport a large amount of magnetic flux to the centre, more than the accreting gas can force into the BH. The excess magnetic flux remains outside the BH, impedes accretion, and leads to a magnetically arrested disc. We find powerful outflows. For a BH with spin parameter a = 0.5, the efficiency with which the accretion system generates outflowing energy in jets and winds is eta≈ 30 per cent. For a = 0.99, we find eta≈ 140 per cent, which means that more energy flows out of the BH than flows in. The only way this can happen is by extracting spin energy from the BH. Thus the a = 0.99 simulation represents an unambiguous demonstration, within an astrophysically plausible scenario, of the extraction of net energy from a spinning BH via the Penrose-Blandford-Znajek mechanism. We suggest that magnetically arrested accretion might explain observations of active galactic nuclei with apparent eta≈ few × 100 per cent.

AB  - The large-scale structure of the universe can be mapped with unresolved intensity fluctuations of the 21 cm line. The power spectrum of the intensity fluctuations has been proposed as a probe of the baryon acoustic oscillations at low to moderate redshifts with interferometric experiments now under consideration. We discuss the contamination to the low-redshift 21 cm intensity power spectrum generated by the 18 cm OH line since the intensity fluctuations of the OH line generated at a slightly higher redshift contribute to the intensity fluctuations observed in an experiment. We assume the OH megamaser luminosity is correlated with the star formation rate and use the simulation to estimate the OH signal and the spatial anisotropies. We also use a semi-analytic simulation to predict the 21 cm power spectrum. At z = 1-3, we find that the OH contamination could reach 0.1%-1% of the 21 cm rms fluctuations at the scale of the first peak of the baryon acoustic oscillation. When z > 3 the OH signal declines quickly, so that the contamination on the 21 cm becomes negligible at high redshifts.

AB  - Testing theories of angular-momentum acquisition of rotationally supported disc galaxies is the key to understanding the formation of this type of galaxies. The tidal-torque theory aims to explain this acquisition process in a cosmological framework and predicts positive autocorrelations of angular-momentum orientation and spiral-arm handedness, i.e. alignment of disc galaxies, on short distance scales of 1 Mpc h-1. This disc alignment can also cause systematic effects in weak-lensing measurements. Previous observations claimed discovering these correlations but are overly optimistic in the reported level of statistical significance of the detections. Errors in redshift, ellipticity and morphological classifications were not taken into account, although they have a significant impact. We explain how to rigorously propagate all the important errors through the estimation process. Analysing disc galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data base, we find that positive autocorrelations of spiral-arm handedness and angular-momentum orientations on distance scales of 1 Mpc h-1 are plausible but not statistically significant. Current data appear not good enough to constrain parameters of theory. This result agrees with a simple hypothesis test in the Local Group, where we also find no evidence for disc alignment. Moreover, we demonstrate that ellipticity estimates based on second moments are strongly biased by galactic bulges even for Scd galaxies, thereby corrupting correlation estimates and overestimating the impact of disc alignment on weak-lensing studies. Finally, we discuss the potential of future sky surveys. We argue that photometric redshifts have too large errors, i.e. PanSTARRS and LSST cannot be used. Conversely, the EUCLID project will not cover the relevant redshift regime. We also discuss the potentials and problems of front-edge classifications of galaxy discs in order to improve the autocorrelation estimates of angular-momentum orientation.

AB  - We present Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations of ammonia (NH3) and the 1.2 cm radio continuum toward the ultraluminous infrared galaxy merger Arp 220. We detect the NH3(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), and (6,6) inversion lines in absorption against the unresolved, (62 $\pm$ 9) mJy continuum source at 1.2 cm. The peak apparent optical depths of the ammonia lines range from ~0.05 to 0.18. The absorption lines are well described by single-component Gaussians with central velocities in between the velocities of the eastern and western cores of Arp 220. Therefore, the ammonia likely traces gas that encompasses both cores. The absorption depth of the NH3(1,1) line is significantly shallower than expected based on the depths of the other transitions. The shallow (1,1) profile may be caused by contamination from emission by a hypothetical, cold (lsim 20 K) gas layer with an estimated column density of <~ 2 × 1014 cm-2. This layer would have to be located behind or away from the radio continuum sources to produce the contaminating emission. The widths of the ammonia absorption lines are ~120-430 km s-1, in agreement with those of other molecular tracers. We cannot confirm the extremely large line widths of up to ~1800 km s-1 previously reported for this galaxy. Using all of the ATCA detections except for the shallow (1,1) line, we determine a rotational temperature of (124 $\pm$ 19) K, corresponding to a kinetic temperature of T kin = (186 $\pm$ 55) K. Ammonia column densities depend on the excitation temperature. For excitation temperatures of 10 K and 50 K, we estimate N(NH3) = (1.7 $\pm$ 0.1) × 1016 cm-2 and (8.4 $\pm$ 0.5) × 1016 cm-2, respectively. The relation scales linearly for possible higher excitation temperatures. Our observations are consistent with an ortho-to-para-ammonia ratio of unity, implying that the ammonia formation temperature exceeds ~30 K. In the context of a model with a molecular ring that connects the two nuclei in Arp 220, we estimate the H2 gas density to be ~f -0.5 V × (1-4) × 103, where f V is the volume filling factor of the molecular gas. In addition to ammonia, our ATCA data show an absorption feature adjacent in frequency to the NH3(3,3) line. The line does not appear in the GBT spectrum. If we interpret the line to be from the OH 2Pi3/2 J = 9/2 F = 4-4 transition, it would have a line width, systemic velocity, and apparent optical depth similar to what we detect in the ammonia lines. Comparing the new line to the previously detected 6 GHz OH 2Pi3/2 J = 5/2 F = 2-2 transition, we determine a rotational OH temperature of ~245 K, about two times the rotational temperature of ammonia. If this association with OH is correct, it marks the first detection of the highly excited (~511 K above ground state) 2Pi3/2 J = 9/2 F = 4-4 OH line in an extragalactic object.

AB  - We present the spectral atlas of sources observed in low resolution with the Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. More than 11,000 distinct sources were extracted using a dedicated algorithm based on the SMART software with an optimal extraction (AdOpt package). These correspond to all 13,000 low-resolution observations of fixed objects (both single source and cluster observations). The pipeline includes image cleaning, individual exposure combination, and background subtraction. Particular attention is given to bad pixel and outlier rejection at the image and spectra levels. Most sources are spatially unresolved so that optimal extraction reaches the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio. For all sources, an alternative extraction is also provided that accounts for all of the source flux within the aperture. CASSIS provides publishable quality spectra through an online database together with several important diagnostics, such as the source spatial extent and a quantitative measure of detection level. Ancillary data such as available spectroscopic redshifts are also provided. The database interface will eventually provide various ways to interact with the spectra, such as on-the-fly measurements of spectral features or comparisons among spectra.

AB  - We present Green Bank Telescope observations of the 312-313 (29 GHz) and 413-414 (48 GHz) transitions of the H2CO molecule toward a sample of 23 well-studied star-forming regions. Analysis of the relative intensities of these transitions can be used to reliably measure the densities of molecular cores. Adopting kinetic temperatures from the literature, we have employed a large velocity gradient (LVG) model to derive the average hydrogen number density (n(H2)) within a 16'' beam toward each source. Densities in the range of 105.5-106.5 cm-3 and ortho-formaldehyde column densities per unit line width between 1013.5 and 1014.5 cm-2 (km s-1)-1 are found for most objects, in general agreement with existing measurements. A detailed analysis of the advantages and limitations to this densitometry technique is also presented. We find that H2CO 312-313/413-414 densitometry proves to be best suited to objects with T K >~ 100 K, above which the H2CO LVG models become relatively independent of kinetic temperature. This study represents the first detection of these H2CO K-doublet transitions in all but one object in our sample. The ease with which these transitions were detected, coupled with their unique sensitivity to spatial density, makes them excellent monitors of density in molecular clouds for future experiments. We also report the detection of the 92-81 A - (29 GHz) transition of CH3OH toward six sources.

AB  - We present the results of a pilot survey for neutral hydrogen (H I) 21 cm absorption in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-Band Feed Array (ALFALFA) Survey. This project is a wide-area ``blind'' search for H I absorption in the local universe, spanning -650 km s-1 < cz < 17, 500 km s-1 and covering 517.0 deg2 (7% of the full ALFALFA survey). The survey is sensitive to H I absorption lines stronger than 7.7 mJy (8983 radio sources) and is 90% complete for lines stronger than 11.0 mJy (7296 sources). The total redshift interval sensitive to all damped Lyalpha (DLA) systems (N_H I >= 2× 10^20 cm-2) is Deltaz = 7.0 (129 objects, assuming Ts = 100 K and covering fraction unity); for super-DLAs (N_H I >= 2× 10^21 cm-2) it is Deltaz = 128.2 (2353 objects). We re-detect the intrinsic H I absorption line in UGC 6081 but detect no intervening absorption line systems. We compute a 95% confidence upper limit on the column density frequency distribution function f(N_H I,X) spanning four orders of magnitude in column density, 1019 (Ts /100 K) (1/f) cm^-2 < N_H I < 10^23 (T_s/100 K)(1/f) cm-2, that is consistent with previous redshifted optical DLA surveys and the aggregate H I 21 cm emission in the local universe. The detection rate is in agreement with extant observations. This pilot survey suggests that an absorption line search of the complete ALFALFA survey - or any higher redshift, larger bandwidth, or more sensitive survey, such as those planned for Square Kilometer Array pathfinders or a low-frequency lunar array - will either make numerous detections or will set a strong statistical lower limit on the typical spin temperature of neutral hydrogen gas.

AB  - We present the discovery of seven ultracool brown dwarfs identified with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Near-infrared spectroscopy reveals deep absorption bands of H2O and CH4 that indicate all seven of the brown dwarfs have spectral types later than UGPS J072227.51-054031.2, the latest-type T dwarf currently known. The spectrum of WISEP J182831.08+265037.8 is distinct in that the heights of the J- and H-band peaks are approximately equal in units of f lambda, so we identify it as the archetypal member of the Y spectral class. The spectra of at least two of the other brown dwarfs exhibit absorption on the blue wing of the H-band peak that we tentatively ascribe to NH3. These spectral morphological changes provide a clear transition between the T dwarfs and the Y dwarfs. In order to produce a smooth near-infrared spectral sequence across the T/Y dwarf transition, we have reclassified UGPS 0722-05 as the T9 spectral standard and tentatively assign WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 as the Y0 spectral standard. In total, six of the seven new brown dwarfs are classified as Y dwarfs: four are classified as Y0, one is classified as Y0 (pec?), and WISEP J1828+2650 is classified as >Y0. We have also compared the spectra to the model atmospheres of Marley and Saumon and infer that the brown dwarfs have effective temperatures ranging from 300 K to 500 K, making them the coldest spectroscopically confirmed brown dwarfs known to date.

AB  - We present a detailed study of PKS 1814-637, a rare case of powerful radio source (P5 GHz = 4.1 × 1025 W Hz-1) hosted by a disk galaxy. Optical images have been used to model the host galaxy morphology confirming it to be dominated by a strong (and warped) disk component that is observed close to edge-on to the line of sight. This is the first radio galaxy found to reside in a disk dominated galaxy with radio luminosity equivalent to powerful FRII objects. At radio wavelengths, PKS 1814-637 is about 480 pc in diameter and it is classified as a compact steep spectrum (CSS) source; such sources are usually considered to be radio sources observed in the early stages of their evolution. However, the optical and mid-IR spectroscopic properties of PKS1814-637 show more in common with Seyfert galaxies than they do with radio galaxies, with the detection of H2, and PAH emission features, along with HI and silicate absorption features, providing evidence for a rich ISM which is likely to be related to the disk morphology of the host galaxy. We argue that the interaction between the radio plasma and the rich ISM in this and similar objects may have boosted their radio emission, allowing them to more easily enter flux limited samples of radio sources. In this case, PKS 1814-637 represents a type of ``imposter'': an intrinsically low power object that is selected in a radio flux limited sample because of the unusually efficient conversion of jet power into radio emission. This would make PKS 1814-637 an extreme example of the effects of jet-cloud interactions in galaxies containing a rich ISM, and perhaps a missing link between radio galaxies and radio-loud Seyfert galaxies. However, it is unlikely that jet-cloud interactions alone can account for the unusually powerful radio emission compared to Seyfert galaxies, and it is probable that the jet in PKS 1814-637 is also intrinsically more powerful than in typical Seyfert galaxies, perhaps due to a higher bulge and black hole mass. The estimated BH mass is indeed higher than the majority of Seyfert galaxies in the local Universe. We speculate that sources similar to PKS1814-637 are likely to be more common at high redshifts, because of the enhanced probability at earlier epochs of triggering radio sources in moderately massive bulges that are also gas-rich.

AB  - Aims: Since no spectroscopic redshift is available for the remarkable BL Lacertae object (BL Lac) 1ES 0647+250, we aim to derive an estimate of its distance from the properties of its host galaxy.  Methods: We obtained a deep, high-resolution near-infrared H-band image of the BL Lac object 1ES 0647+250.  Results: We are able to detect the underlying host galaxy in the near-infrared. The host galaxy has an H-band magnitude of 16.9 $\pm$ 0.2 and an effective radius of 1.6 arcsec $\pm$ 0.3 arcsec.  Using the imaging redshift method developed by Sbarufatti and collaborators, we estimate a redshift z = 0.41 $\pm$ 0.06. This redshift is consistent with the previously reported imaging redshift estimate from the optical i'-band of z = 0.45 $\pm$ 0.08, and with previously reported lower limits to the redshift. It agrees with constraints from its gamma-ray emission.  Conclusions: We encourage imaging searches in the near-infrared, even with moderately sized telescopes, of the host galaxies of BL Lac objects at unknown redshift, as well as optical spectroscopy studies of 1ES 0647+250 with large telescopes to determine its spectroscopic redshift.

AB  - Energetic feedback from supernovae (SNe) and from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are both important processes that are thought to control how much gas is able to condense into galaxies and form stars. We show that although both AGN and SNe suppress star formation, they mutually weaken one another's effect by up to an order of magnitude in haloes in the mass range for which both feedback processes are efficient (). These results demonstrate the importance of the simultaneous, non-independent inclusion of these two processes in models of galaxy formation to estimate the total feedback strength. These results are of particular relevance to the interpretation of results from hydrodynamical simulations that model only one of the feedback processes, and also to those semi-analytic models that implicitly assume the effects of the two feedback processes to be independent.

AB  - We investigate the interactions of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) with nuclei in the human body. We are motivated by the fact that WIMPs are excellent candidates for the dark matter in the Universe. Our estimates use a 70 kg human and a variety of WIMP masses and cross-sections. The contributions from individual elements in the body are presented and it is found that the dominant contribution is from scattering off of oxygen (hydrogen) nuclei for the spin-independent (spin-dependent) interactions. For the case of 60 GeV WIMPs, we find that, of the billions of WIMPs passing through a human body per second, roughly ˜10 WIMPs hit one of the nuclei in the human body in an average year, if the scattering is at the maximum consistent with current bounds on WIMP interactions. We also study the 10-20 GeV WIMPs with much larger cross-sections that best fit the DAMA, COGENT, and CRESST data sets and find much higher rates: in this case as many as 105 WIMPs hit a nucleus in the human body in an average year, corresponding to almost one a minute. Though WIMP interactions are a source of radiation in the body, the annual exposure is negligible compared to that from other natural sources (including radon and cosmic rays), and the WIMP collisions are harmless to humans.

AB  - We present a clustering analysis of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in Stripe 82 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We study the angular two-point autocorrelation function, w(theta), of a selected sample of over 130 000 LRG candidates via colour-cut selections in izK with the K-band coverage coming from UKIRT (United Kingdom Infrared Telescope) Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Large Area Survey (LAS). We have used the cross-correlation technique of Newman to establish the redshift distribution of the LRGs. Cross-correlating them with SDSS quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), MegaZ-LRGs and DEEP Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2) galaxies, implies an average redshift of the LRGs to be z ≈ 1 with space density, ng ≈ 3.20 $\pm$ 0.16 × 10-4 h3 Mpc-3. For theta <= 10 arcmin (corresponding to ≈10 h-1 Mpc), the LRG w(theta) significantly deviates from a conventional single power law as noted by previous clustering studies of highly biased and luminous galaxies. A double power law with a break at rb ≈ 2.4 h-1 Mpc fits the data better, with best-fitting scale length, r0, 1 = 7.63 $\pm$ 0.27 h-1 Mpc and slope gamma1 = 2.01 $\pm$ 0.02 at small scales and r0, 2 = 9.92 $\pm$ 0.40 h-1 Mpc and gamma2 = 1.64 $\pm$ 0.04 at large scales. Due to the flat slope at large scales, we find that a standard Lambda cold dark matter (Lambda CDM) linear model is accepted only at 2-3sigma, with the best-fitting bias factor, b = 2.74 $\pm$ 0.07. We also fitted the halo occupation distribution (HOD) models to compare our measurements with the predictions of the dark matter clustering. The effective halo mass of Stripe 82 LRGs is estimated as Meff = 3.3 $\pm$ 0.6 × 1013 h-1 M&sun;. But at large scales, the current HOD models did not help explain the power excess in the clustering signal.  We then compare the w(theta) results to the results of Sawangwit et al. from three samples of photometrically selected LRGs at lower redshifts to measure clustering evolution. We find that a long-lived model may be a poorer fit than at lower redshifts, although this assumes that the Stripe 82 LRGs are luminosity-matched to the AAOmega LRGs. We find stronger evidence for evolution in the form of the z ≈ 1 LRG correlation function with the above flat two-halo slope maintaining to s ≳ 50 h- 1 Mpc. Applying the cross-correlation test of Ross et al., we find little evidence that the result is due to systematics. Otherwise, it may represent evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity in the density perturbations at early times, with flocalNL = 90 $\pm$ 30.

AB  - We analyse the role of bars in the build-up of central mass concentrations in massive, disc galaxies. Our parent sample consists of 3757 face-on disc galaxies with redshifts between 0.01 and 0.05, selected from the seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. 1555 galaxies with bars are identified using the position angle and ellipticity profiles of the i-band light. We compare the ratio of the specific star formation rate measured in the 1-3 kpc central region of the galaxy to that measured for the whole galaxy. Galaxies with strong bars have centrally enhanced star formation; the degree of enhancement depends primarily on the ellipticity of the bar and not on the size of the bar or on the mass or structure of the host galaxy. The fraction of galaxies with strong bars is highest at stellar masses greater than 3 × 1010 M&sun;, stellar surface densities less than 3 × 108 M&sun; and concentration indices less than 2.5. In this region of parameter space, galaxies with strong bars either have enhanced central star formation rates, or star formation that is suppressed compared to the mean. This suggests that bars may play a role in the eventual quenching of star formation in galaxies. Only 50 per cent of galaxies with strongly concentrated star formation have strong bars, indicating that other processes such as galaxy interactions also induce central starbursts. We also find that the ratio of the size of the bar to that of the disc depends mainly on the colour of the galaxy, suggesting that the growth and destruction of bars are regulated by gas accretion, as suggested by simulations.

AB  - Ground-based optical surveys such as PanSTARRS, DES, and LSST will produce large catalogs to limiting magnitudes of r >~ 24. Star-galaxy separation poses a major challenge to such surveys because galaxies---even very compact galaxies---outnumber halo stars at these depths. We investigate photometric classification techniques on stars and galaxies with intrinsic FWHM <0.2 arcsec. We consider unsupervised spectral energy distribution template fitting and supervised, data-driven support vector machines (SVMs). For template fitting, we use a maximum likelihood (ML) method and a new hierarchical Bayesian (HB) method, which learns the prior distribution of template probabilities from the data. SVM requires training data to classify unknown sources; ML and HB do not. We consider (1) a best-case scenario (SVMbest) where the training data are (unrealistically) a random sampling of the data in both signal-to-noise and demographics and (2) a more realistic scenario where training is done on higher signal-to-noise data (SVMreal) at brighter apparent magnitudes. Testing with COSMOS ugriz data, we find that HB outperforms ML, delivering ~80% completeness, with purity of ~60%-90% for both stars and galaxies. We find that no algorithm delivers perfect performance and that studies of metal-poor main-sequence turnoff stars may be challenged by poor star-galaxy separation. Using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, we find a best-to-worst ranking of SVMbest, HB, ML, and SVMreal. We conclude, therefore, that a well-trained SVM will outperform template-fitting methods. However, a normally trained SVM performs worse. Thus, HB template fitting may prove to be the optimal classification method in future surveys.

AB  - We have used high-resolution, Hubble Space Telescope, near-infrared imaging to conduct a detailed analysis of the morphological properties of the most massive galaxies at high redshift, modelling the WFC3/IR H160-band images of the ~=200 galaxies in the CANDELS-UDS field with photometric redshifts 1 < z < 3, and stellar masses M* > 1011 M&sun;. We have explored the results of fitting single-Sérsic and bulge+disc models, and have investigated the additional errors and potential biases introduced by uncertainties in the background and the on-image point spread function. This approach has enabled us to obtain formally acceptable model fits to the WFC3/IR images of >90 per cent of the galaxies. Our results indicate that these massive galaxies at 1 < z < 3 lie both on and below the local size-mass relation, with a median effective radius of ˜2.6 kpc, a factor of ~=2.3 smaller than comparably massive local galaxies. Moreover, we find that bulge-dominated objects in particular show evidence for a growing bimodality in the size-mass relation with increasing redshift, and by z > 2 the compact bulges display effective radii a factor of ~=4 smaller than local ellipticals of comparable mass. These trends also appear to extend to the bulge components of disc-dominated galaxies. In addition, we find that, while such massive galaxies at low redshift are generally bulge-dominated, at redshifts 1 < z < 2 they are predominantly mixed bulge+disc systems, and by z > 2 they are mostly disc-dominated. The majority of the disc-dominated galaxies are actively forming stars, although this is also true for many of the bulge-dominated systems. Interestingly, however, while most of the quiescent galaxies are bulge-dominated, we find that a significant fraction (25-40 per cent) of the most quiescent galaxies, with specific star formation rates sSFR < 10-10 yr-1, have disc-dominated morphologies. Thus, while our results show that the massive galaxy population is undergoing dramatic changes at this crucial epoch, they also suggest that the physical mechanisms which quench star formation activity are not simply connected to those responsible for the morphological transformation of massive galaxies into present-day giant ellipticals.

AB  - We distinguish between Local Group field galaxies that may have passed through the virial volume of the Milky Way, and those that have not, via a statistical comparison against populations of dark matter haloes in the Via Lactea II (VLII) simulation with known orbital histories. Analysis of VLII provides expectations for this escaped population: they contribute 13 per cent of the galactic population between 300 and 1500 kpc from the Milky Way, and hence we anticipate that about 7 of the 54 known Local Group galaxies in that distance range are likely to be Milky Way escapees. These objects can be of any mass below that of the Milky Way, and they are expected to have positive radial velocities with respect to the Milky Way. Comparison of the radius-velocity distributions of VLII populations and measurements of Local Group galaxies presents a strong likelihood that Tucana, Cetus, NGC 3109, Sextans A, Sextans B, Antlia, NGC 6822, Phoenix, Leo T and NGC 185 have passed through the Milky Way. Most of these dwarfs have a lower H I mass fraction than the majority of dwarfs lying at similar distances to either the Milky Way or M31. Indeed, several of these galaxies - especially those with lower masses - contain signatures in their morphology, star formation history and/or gas content indicative of evolution seen in simulations of satellite/parent galactic interactions. Our results offer strong support for scenarios in which dwarfs of different types form a sequence in morphology and gas content, with evolution along the sequence being driven by interaction history.

AB  - Observations of nearby galaxies have firmly established, over a broad range of galactic environments and metallicities, that star formation occurs exclusively in the molecular phase of the interstellar medium (ISM). Theoretical models show that this association results from the correlation between chemical phase, shielding, and temperature. Interstellar gas converts from atomic to molecular only in regions that are well shielded from interstellar ultraviolet (UV) photons, and since UV photons are also the dominant source of interstellar heating, only in these shielded regions does the gas become cold enough to be subject to Jeans instability. However, while the equilibrium temperature and chemical state of interstellar gas are well correlated, the timescale required to reach chemical equilibrium is much longer than that required to reach thermal equilibrium, and both timescales are metallicity-dependent. Here I show that the difference in timescales implies that, at metallicities below a few percent of the solar value, well shielded gas will reach low temperatures and proceed to star formation before the bulk of it is able to convert from atomic to molecular. As a result, at extremely low metallicities, star formation will occur in a cold atomic phase of the ISM rather than a molecular phase. I calculate the observable consequences of this result for star formation in low-metallicity galaxies, and I discuss how some current numerical models for H2-regulated star formation may need to be modified.

AB  - We present observational evidence for the inhibition of bar formation in dispersion-dominated (dynamically hot) galaxies by studying the relationship between galactic structure and host galaxy kinematics in a sample of 257 galaxies between 0.1 < z <= 0.84 from the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey and the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 survey. We find that bars are preferentially found in galaxies that are massive and dynamically cold (rotation-dominated) and on the stellar Tully-Fisher relationship, as is the case for barred spirals in the local universe. The data provide at least one explanation for the steep (×3) decline in the overall bar fraction from z = 0 to z = 0.84 in L* and brighter disks seen in previous studies. The decline in the bar fraction at high redshift is almost exclusively in the lower mass (10 < log M *(M &sun;) < 11), later-type, and bluer galaxies. A proposed explanation for this ``downsizing'' of the bar formation/stellar structure formation is that the lower mass galaxies may not form bars because they could be dynamically hotter than more massive systems from the increased turbulence of accreting gas, elevated star formation, and/or increased interaction/merger rate at higher redshifts. The evidence presented here provides observational support for this hypothesis. However, the data also show that not every disk galaxy that is massive and cold has a stellar bar, suggesting that mass and dynamic coldness of a disk are necessary but not sufficient conditions for bar formation---a secondary process, perhaps the interaction history between the dark matter halo and the baryonic matter, may play an important role in bar formation.

AB  - Context. Analysing the empirical output from large surveys is an important challenge in contemporary science. Difficulties arise, in particular, when the database is huge and the properties of the object types to be selected are poorly constrained a priori.  Aims: We present the novel, semi-automated clustering tool ASPECT for analysing voluminous archives of spectra.  Methods: The heart of the program is a neural network in the form of a Kohonen self-organizing map. The resulting map is designed as an icon map suitable for the inspection by eye. The visual analysis is supported by the option to blend in individual object properties such as redshift, apparent magnitude, or signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, the package provides several tools for the selection of special spectral types, e.g. local difference maps which reflect the deviations of all spectra from one given input spectrum (real or artificial).  Results: ASPECT is able to produce a two-dimensional topological map of a huge number of spectra. The software package enables the user to browse and navigate through a huge data pool and helps them to gain an insight into underlying relationships between the spectra and other physical properties and to get the big picture of the entire data set. We demonstrate the capability of ASPECT by clustering the entire data pool of ~6 × 105 spectra from the Data Release 4 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To illustrate the results regarding quality and completeness we track objects from existing catalogues of quasars and carbon stars, respectively, and connect the SDSS spectra with morphological information from the GalaxyZoo project.  Code is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/547/A115

AB  - The bimodality in galaxy properties has been observed at low and high redshifts, with a clear distinction between star-forming galaxies in the blue cloud and passively evolving objects in the red sequence; the absence of galaxies with intermediate properties indicates that the quenching of star formation and subsequent transition between populations must happen rapidly. In this paper, we present a study of over 100 transiting galaxies in the so-called green valley at intermediate redshifts (z ~ 0.8). By using very deep spectroscopy with the DEIMOS instrument at the Keck telescope we are able to infer the star formation histories of these objects and measure the stellar mass flux density transiting from the blue cloud to the red sequence when the universe was half its current age. Our results indicate that the process happened more rapidly and for more massive galaxies in the past, suggesting a top-down scenario in which the massive end of the red sequence is forming first. This represents another aspect of downsizing, with the mass flux density moving toward smaller galaxies in recent times.

AB  - The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) is producing the most detailed inventory of the gamma-ray sky to date. Despite tremendous achievements approximately 25 per cent of all Fermi extragalactic sources in the Second Fermi Large Area Telescope Catalogue (2FGL) are listed as active galactic nuclei (AGN) of uncertain type. Typically, these are suspected blazar candidates without a conclusive optical spectrum or lacking spectroscopic observations. Here, we explore the use of machine-learning algorithms - random forests and support vector machines - to predict specific AGN subclass based on observed gamma-ray spectral properties. After training and testing on identified/associated AGN from the 2FGL we find that 235 out of 269 AGN of uncertain type have properties compatible with gamma-ray BL Lacertae and flat-spectrum radio quasars with accuracy rates of 85 per cent. Additionally, direct comparison of our results with class predictions made after following the infrared colour-colour space of Massaro et al. shows that the agreement rate is over four-fifths for 54 overlapping sources, providing independent cross-validation. These results can help tailor follow-up spectroscopic programmes and inform future pointed surveys with ground-based Cherenkov telescopes.

AB  - We present the spatial clustering properties of 1466 X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) compiled from the Chandra Deep Field (CDF) North and South, extended CDF-S, COSMOS and All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey (AEGIS) fields in the 0.5-8 keV band. The X-ray sources span the redshift interval 0 < z < 3 and have a median value of barz=0.976. We employ the projected two-point correlation function to infer the spatial clustering and find a clustering length of r0 = 7.2 $\pm$ 0.6 h-1 Mpc and a slope of gamma = 1.48 $\pm$ 0.12, which corresponds to a bias of b(barz)=2.26 $\pm$ 0.16. Using two different halo bias models, we consistently estimate an average dark-matter host halo mass of Mh ~= 1.3($\pm$ 0.3) × 1013 h-1 M&sun;. The X-ray AGN bias and the corresponding dark-matter host halo mass are significantly higher than the corresponding values of optically selected AGN (at the same redshifts). The redshift evolution of the X-ray-selected AGN bias indicates, in agreement with other recent studies, that a unique dark-matter halo mass does not fit well the bias at all the different redshifts probed. Furthermore, we investigate if there is a dependence of the clustering strength on X-ray luminosity. To this end we consider only 650 sources around z ˜ 1 and we apply a procedure to disentangle the dependence of clustering on redshift. We find indications for a positive dependence of the clustering length on X-ray luminosity, in the sense that the more luminous sources have a larger clustering length and hence a higher dark-matter halo mass. In detail we find for an average luminosity difference of delta log10Lx ~= 1 a halo mass difference of a factor of ˜3.  These findings appear to be consistent with a galaxy formation model where the gas accreted on to the supermassive black hole in intermediate-luminosity AGN comes mostly from the hot-halo atmosphere around the host galaxy.

AB  - We present new observations of the recently discovered gas cloud G2 currently falling toward the massive black hole in the Galactic Center. The new data confirm that G2 is on a highly elliptical orbit with a predicted pericenter passage mid-2013. The updated orbit has an even larger eccentricity of 0.966, an epoch of pericenter two months later than estimated before, and a nominal minimum distance of 2200 Schwarzschild radii only. The velocity gradient of G2 has developed further to 600 km s-1 FWHM in summer 2012. We also detect the tail of similar total flux and on the same orbit as G2 along the trajectory at high significance. No hydrodynamic effects are detected yet, since the simple model of a tidally shearing gas cloud still describes the data very well. The flux of G2 has not changed by more than 10% between 2008 and 2012, disfavoring models where additional gas from a reservoir is released to the disrupting diffuse gas component.

AB  - Bent-double radio sources have been used as a probe to measure the density of intergalactic gas in galaxy groups. We carry out a series of high-resolution, three-dimensional simulations of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets moving through an external medium with a constant density in order to develop a general formula for the radius of curvature of the jets, and to determine how accurately the density of the intra-group medium (IGM) can be measured. Our simulations produce curved jets ending in bright radio lobes with an extended trail of low surface brightness radio emission. The radius of curvature of the jets varies with time by only about 25 per cent. The radio trail seen in our simulations is typically not detected in known sources, but may be detectable in lower resolution radio observations. The length of this tail can be used to determine the age of the AGN. We also use our simulation data to derive a formula for the kinetic luminosity of observed jets in terms of the radius of curvature and jet pressure. In characterizing how well observations can measure the IGM density, we find that the limited resolution of typical radio observations leads to a systematic underestimate of the IGM density of about 50 per cent. The unknown angles between the observer and the direction of jet propagation and direction of AGN motion through the IGM lead to an uncertainty of about $\pm$50 per cent in estimates of the IGM density. Previous conclusions drawn using these sources, indicating that galaxy groups contain significant reservoirs of baryons in their IGM, are still valid when considering this level of uncertainty. In addition, we model the X-ray emission expected from bent-double radio sources. We find that known sources in reasonably dense environments should be detectable in ˜100 ks Chandra observations. X-ray observations of these sources would place constraints on the IGM density and AGN velocity that are complementary to radio observations.

AB  - We examine the changes in the properties of galactic bulges and discs with environment for a volume-limited sample of 12 500 nearby galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We focus on galaxies with classical bulges. Classical bulges seem to have the same formation history as ellipticals of the same mass, and we test if environment determines whether or not a classical bulge possesses a disc. Using the projected fifth nearest neighbour density as a measure of local environment, we look for correlations with environment at fixed bulge stellar mass. In groups with fewer than 20 members, we find no evidence for changes in disc morphology with local density. At fixed bulge mass, disc mass and disc scalelength are independent of local density. However, disc colour does increase [Delta(g - r) ˜ 0.05 mag] as a function of local density in relatively poor groups. Therefore, the colour-density relation for classical bulge+disc galaxies in the field and in poor groups is solely due to changes in disc colour with density. In contrast, we find no correlations between disc colour and local density for classical bulge+disc galaxies in large, relaxed groups and clusters. However, there is a weak correlation between disc mass and group crossing time, suggesting that morphological transformation takes places in rich groups. Our results add to the evidence that star formation is quenched in group environments, instead of clusters, and that star formation quenching and morphological transformation are separate processes. Overall, we show that environment has two effects on galactic discs: relatively low-density environments can quench star formation in discs, while processes occurring in higher density environments contribute to the morphological transformation from disc-dominated systems to bulge-dominated systems.

AB  - Exponential, de Vaucouleurs, and Sérsic profiles are simple and successful models for fitting two-dimensional images of galaxies. One numerical issue encountered in this kind of fitting is the pixel rendering and convolution (or correlation) of the models with the telescope point-spread function (PSF); these operations are slow, and easy to get slightly wrong at small radii. Here we exploit the realization that these models can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy with a mixture (linear superposition) of two-dimensional Gaussians (MoGs). MoGs are fast to render and fast to affine-transform. Most importantly, if you have a MoG model for the pixel-convolved PSF, the PSF-convolved, affine-transformed galaxy models are themselves MoGs and therefore very fast to compute, integrate, and render precisely. We present worked examples that can be directly used in image fitting; we are using them ourselves. The MoG profiles we provide can be swapped in to replace the standard models in any image-fitting code; they sped up model fitting in our projects by an order of magnitude; they ought to make any code faster at essentially no cost in precision.

Methods: We analyzed the spectra of galaxies in the environment of AGN and other activity classes up to distances of 1 Mpc.  Results: The mean Halpha and [O iii] lambda5007 line luminosities in the environmental galaxies within a projected radius of 1 Mpc are highest around Seyfert 1 galaxies, with decreasing luminosities for Seyfert 2 and HII galaxies, and lowest for absorption line galaxies. Furthermore, there is a trend toward Halpha and [OIII] luminosities in the environmental galaxies increasing as a function of proximity to the central emission line galaxies. There is another clear trend toward a neighborhood effect within a radius of 1000 kpc for the AGN and non-AGN types: Seyfert galaxies tend to have the highest probability of having another Seyfert galaxy in the neighborhood. HII galaxies tend to have the highest probability of having another HII galaxy in the neighborhood, etc. The number of companions within 1000 kpc is inversely correlated with the Halpha, [O iii] lambda5007, as well as with the continuum luminosities of the central galaxies, regardless of whether they are of Seyfert, HII, or absorption line types.  Based on Sloan Data.

AB  - We introduce Astronomy and Computing, a new journal for the growing population of people working in the domain where astronomy overlaps with computer science and information technology. The journal aims to provide a new communication channel within that community, which is not well served by current journals, and to help secure recognition of its true importance within modern astronomy. In this inaugural editorial, we describe the rationale for creating the journal, outline its scope and ambitions, and seek input from the community in defining in detail how the journal should work towards its high-level goals.

AB  - In the local Universe, galaxies in groups and clusters contain less gas and are less likely to be forming stars than their field counterparts. This effect is not limited to the central group/cluster regions, but is shown by recent observations to persist out to several virial radii. To gain insight into the extent and cause of this large-scale environmental influence, we use a suite of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to analyse galaxies around simulated groups and clusters of a wide range of mass (log 10Mhost/M&sun; = [13.0, 15.2]). In qualitative agreement with the observations, we find a systematic depletion of both hot and cold gas and a decline in the star-forming fraction of galaxies as far out as ˜5r200 from the host centre. A substantial fraction of these galaxies are on highly elliptical orbits and are not infalling for the first time (˜50 per cent at 2r200, independent of host mass) or are affected by `pre-processing' (less than 10 per cent of galaxies around groups, increasing to ˜50 per cent near a massive cluster), even a combination of these indirect mechanisms does not fully account for the environmental influence, particularly in the case of the hot gas content. Direct ram pressure interaction with an extended gas `halo' surrounding groups and clusters is shown to be sufficiently strong to strip the hot gas atmospheres of infalling galaxies out to ˜5r200. We show that this influence is highly anisotropic, with ram pressure along filaments enhanced by up to a factor of 100 despite significant co-flow of gas and galaxies.

AB  - The effects that interactions produce on galaxy disks and how they modify the subsequent formation of bars need to be distinguished to fully understand the relationship between bars and environment. To this aim we derive the bar fraction in three different environments ranging from the field to Virgo and Coma Clusters, covering an unprecedentedly large range of galaxy luminosities (or, equivalently, stellar masses). We confirm that the fraction of barred galaxies strongly depends on galaxy luminosity. We also show that the difference between the bar fraction distributions as a function of galaxy luminosity (and mass) in the field and Coma Cluster is statistically significant, with Virgo being an intermediate case. The fraction of barred galaxies shows a maximum of about 50% at Mr ~= - 20.5 in clusters, whereas the peak is shifted to Mr ~= - 19 in the field. We interpret this result as a variation of the effect of environment on bar formation depending on galaxy luminosity. We speculate that brighter disk galaxies are stable enough against interactions to keep their cold structure, thus, the interactions are able to trigger bar formation. For fainter galaxies, the interactions become strong enough to heat up the disks inhibiting bar formation and even destroying the disks. Finally, we point out that the controversy regarding whether the bar fraction depends on environment could be resolved by taking into account the different luminosity ranges probed by the galaxy samples studied so far.

AB  - We present the results of a comprehensive survey using the Arecibo Observatory for Zeeman splitting of OH lines in OH megamasers (OHMs). A total of 77 sources were observed with the Arecibo telescope. Of these, maser emission could not be detected for eight sources, and two sources were only ambiguously detected. Another 27 sources were detected at low signal-to-noise ratios or with interference that prevented placing any useful limits on the presence of magnetic fields. In 26 sources, it was possible to place upper limits on the magnitude of magnetic fields, typically between 10 and 30 mG. For 14 sources, the Stokes V spectra exhibit features consistent with Zeeman splitting. Eleven of these 14 are new detections, and the remaining three are re-detections of Stokes V detections in Robishaw et al. Among confident new detections, we derive magnetic fields associated with maser regions with magnitudes ranging from 6.1 to 27.6 mG. The distribution of magnetic field strengths suggests the magnetic fields in OH masing clouds in OHMs are larger than those in Galactic OH masers. The results are consistent with magnetic fields playing a dynamically important role in OH masing clouds in OHMs.

AB  - We use sensitive observations of three high-redshift sources: [C II] ^2P_3/2 --> ^2P_1/2 fine-structure and CO (J = 2 --> 1) rotational transitions for the z = 6.4 quasar (QSO) host galaxy J1148+5251 taken with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) and Jansky Very Large Array, respectively, and [C II] and CO (J = 5 --> 4) transitions from the QSO BR1202-0725 and its companion sub-millimetre galaxy (SMG) at z = 4.7 taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and the PdBI. We use these observations to place constraints on the quantity Delta z = z_CO - z_C II for each source where zCO and z_C II are the observed redshifts of the CO rotational transition and [C II] fine-structure transition, respectively, using a combination of approaches: (1) modelling the emission line profiles using `shapelets' - a complete orthonormal set of basis functions that allow us to recreate most physical line shapes - to compare both the emission redshifts and the line profiles themselves, in order to make inferences about the intrinsic velocity differences between the molecular and atomic gas, and (2) performing a marginalization over all model parameters in order to calculate a non-parametric estimate of Deltaz. We derive 99 per cent confidence intervals for the marginalized posterior of Deltaz of (-1.9 $\pm$ 1.3) × 10-3, (-3 $\pm$ 8) × 10-4 and (-2 $\pm$ 4) × 10-3 for J1148+5251, and the BR1202-0725 QSO and SMG, respectively. We show that the [C II] and CO (J = 2 --> 1) line profiles for J1148+5251 are consistent with each other within the limits of the data, whilst the [C II] and CO (J = 5 --> 4) line profiles from the BR1202-0725 QSO and SMG, respectively, have 65 and >99.9 per cent probabilities of being inconsistent, with the CO (J = 5 --> 4) lines ˜30 per cent wider than the [C II] lines. Therefore, whilst the observed values of Deltaz can correspond to variations in the quantity DeltaF/F with cosmic time, where F = alpha2/mu, with alpha the fine-structure constant and mu the proton-to-electron mass ratio, of both (-3.3 $\pm$ 2.3) × 10-4 for a look-back time of 12.9 Gyr and of (-5 $\pm$ 15) × 10-5 for a look-back time of 12.4 Gyr, we propose that they are the result of the two species of gas being spatially separated as indicated by the inconsistencies in their line profiles.

AB  - We present precise H I 21 cm absorption line redshifts observed in multiple epochs to directly constrain the secular redshift drift z or the cosmic acceleration, Deltav/Deltat circle. A comparison of literature analog spectra to contemporary digital spectra shows significant acceleration likely attributable to systematic instrumental errors. However, we obtain robust constraints using primarily Green Bank Telescope digital data. Ten objects spanning z = 0.09-0.69 observed over 13.5 years show z = (-2.3\,+/- \,0.8)\times 10^-8 yr-1 or Deltav/Deltat circle = -5.5 $\pm$ 2.2 m s-1 yr-1. The best constraint from a single object, 3C 286 at langzrang = 0.692153275(85), is z = (1.6\,+/- \,4.7)\times 10^-8 yr-1 or Deltav/Deltat circle = 2.8 $\pm$ 8.4 m s-1 yr-1. These measurements are three orders of magnitude larger than the theoretically expected acceleration at z = 0.5, z = 2\times 10^-11 yr-1 or Deltav/Deltat circle = 0.3 cm s-1 yr-1, but they demonstrate the lack of peculiar acceleration in absorption line systems and the long-term frequency stability of modern radio telescopes. A comparison of UV metal absorption lines to the 21 cm line improves constraints on the cosmic variation of physical constants: Delta(alpha2 gp mu)/alpha2 gp mu = (- 1.2 $\pm$ 1.4) × 10-6 in the redshift range z = 0.24-2.04. The linear evolution over the last 10.4 Gyr is (- 0.2 $\pm$ 2.7) × 10-16 yr-1, consistent with no variation. The cosmic acceleration could be directly measured in ~125 years using current telescopes or in ~5 years using a Square Kilometer Array, but systematic effects will arise at the 1 cm s-1 yr-1 level.

AB  - I present some insights into Hanny's Voorwerp and the Antikythera mechanism - contrasting their similarities and differences. They are both excellent examples of serendipitous discoveries in which human curiosity and perseverance have played an important role. Both objects have captured the imagination of the general public, and their discovery was only made possible via the introduction of new technologies. One major difference is that there is only one Antikythera device but there are now many Voorwerpen or ``voorwerpjes'', as they are more commonly known. The study of a collection of objects, as is common in astronomy, greatly aids our understanding of cosmic phenomena. In the case of the voorwepjes, we now know that such systems are to be identified with obscured galaxies or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) that appear to have recently and indeed rapidly turned off. Clearly, the discovery of more examples of devices similar to the Antikythera mechanism would have a significant affect in advancing our understanding of this object and the people that constructed it. Thus far, surveys of the site of the Antikythera wreck are incomplete and non-systematic. Like radio astronomy and other progressive fields, technological advances proceed exponentially in terms of capacity and capability. Recent advances in diving technology are no exception to this rule. It is almost 40 years ago that Jacques Cousteau led the last adhoc survey of the Antikythera wreck - the time has surely come to revisit the site and conduct a proper scientific and systematic survey. The deepest areas of the site are so far completely unexplored while it is known that some artefacts did fall into this area during the original excavation. During this workshop, I called for a return to the site using the most modern diving technologies.

AB  - We present the results of fitting simulations of an unbiased sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies utilizing the fitting routine GALFIT and analysis pipeline PYMORPH. These simulations are used to test the two-dimensional decompositions of SDSS galaxies. The simulations show that single Sérsic models of SDSS data are recovered with sigmamag ≈ 0.025 mag and sigmaradius ≈ 5 per cent. The global values (half-light radius and magnitude) are equally well constrained when a two-component model is used. Sub-components of two-component models present more scatter. SDSS resolution is the primary source of error in the recovery of models. We use a simple statistical correction of the biases in fitted parameters, providing an example using the Sérsic index. Fitting a two-component Sérsic + Exponential model to a single Sérsic galaxy results in a noisier, but unbiased, recovery of the input parameters (sigmatotalmag ≈ 0.075 mag and sigmaradius ≈ 10 per cent); fitting a single Sérsic profile to a two-component system results in biases of total magnitude and half-light radius of ≈ 0.05-0.10 mag and 5-10 per cent in radius. Using an F-test to select the best-fitting model from among the single- and two-component models is sufficient to remove this bias. We recommend fitting a two-component model to all galaxies when attempting to measure global parameters such as total magnitude and half-light radius.

AB  - We present a probabilistic approach for inferring the parameters of the present-day power-law stellar mass function (MF) of a resolved young star cluster. This technique (1) fully exploits the information content of a given data set; (2) can account for observational uncertainties in a straightforward way; (3) assigns meaningful uncertainties to the inferred parameters; (4) avoids the pitfalls associated with binning data; and (5) can be applied to virtually any resolved young cluster, laying the groundwork for a systematic study of the high-mass stellar MF (M >~ 1 M &sun;). Using simulated clusters and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the probability distribution functions, we show that estimates of the MF slope, alpha, are unbiased and that the uncertainty, Deltaalpha, depends primarily on the number of observed stars and on the range of stellar masses they span, assuming that the uncertainties on individual masses and the completeness are both well characterized. Using idealized mock data, we compute the theoretical precision, i.e., lower limits, on alpha, and provide an analytic approximation for Deltaalpha as a function of the observed number of stars and mass range. Comparison with literature studies shows that ~3/4 of quoted uncertainties are smaller than the theoretical lower limit. By correcting these uncertainties to the theoretical lower limits, we find that the literature studies yield langalpharang = 2.46, with a 1sigma dispersion of 0.35 dex. We verify that it is impossible for a power-law MF to obtain meaningful constraints on the upper mass limit of the initial mass function, beyond the lower bound of the most massive star actually observed. We show that avoiding substantial biases in the MF slope requires (1) including the MF as a prior when deriving individual stellar mass estimates, (2) modeling the uncertainties in the individual stellar masses, and (3) fully characterizing and then explicitly modeling the completeness for stars of a given mass. The precision on MF slope recovery in this paper are lower limits, as we do not explicitly consider all possible sources of uncertainty, including dynamical effects (e.g., mass segregation), unresolved binaries, and non-coeval populations. We briefly discuss how each of these effects can be incorporated into extensions of the present framework. Finally, we emphasize that the technique and lessons learned are applicable to more general problems involving power-law fitting.

AB  - There are many pertinent open issues in the area of star and planet formation. Large statistical samples of young stars across star-forming regions are needed to trigger a breakthrough in our understanding, but most optical studies are based on a wide variety of spectrographs and analysis methods, which introduces large biases.  Here we show how graphical Bayesian networks can be employed to construct a hierarchical probabilistic model which allows pre-main-sequence ages, masses, accretion rates and extinctions to be estimated using two widely available photometric survey data bases (Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric Halpha Survey r'/Halpha/i' and Two Micron All Sky Survey J-band magnitudes). Because our approach does not rely on spectroscopy, it can easily be applied to ho-mogeneously study the large number of clusters for which Gaia will yield membership lists.  We explain how the analysis is carried out using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method and provide PYTHON source code. We then demonstrate its use on 587 known low-mass members of the star-forming region NGC 2264 (Cone Nebula), arriving at a median age of 3.0 Myr, an accretion fraction of 20 $\pm$ 2 per cent and a median accretion rate of 10-8.4 M&sun; yr-1.  The Bayesian analysis formulated in this work delivers results which are in agreement with spectroscopic studies already in the literature, but achieves this with great efficiency by depending only on photometry. It is a significant step forward from previous photometric studies because the probabilistic approach ensures that nuisance parameters, such as extinction and distance, are fully included in the analysis with a clear picture on any degeneracies.

AB  - We select a sample of young passive galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7 in order to study the processes that quench star formation in the local universe. Quenched galaxies are identified based on the contribution of A-type stars to their observed (central) spectra and relative lack of ongoing star formation; we find that such systems account for roughly 2.5 per cent of all galaxies with log ( M/M_odot ) ge 9.5, and have a space density of ˜2.2 × 10-4 Mpc-3. We show that quenched galaxies span a range of morphologies, but visual classifications suggest that they are predominantly early-type systems. Their visual early-type classification is supported by quantitative structural measurements (Sérsic indices) that show a notable lack of disc-dominated galaxies, suggesting that any morphological transformation associated with galaxies' transition from star forming to passive - e.g. the formation of a stellar bulge - occurs contemporaneously with the decline of their star formation activity. We show that there is no clear excess of optical active galactic nuclei (AGN) in quenched galaxies, suggesting that: (i) AGN feedback is not associated with the majority of quenched systems or (ii) that the observability of quenched galaxies is such that the quenching phase in general outlives any associated nuclear activity. Comparison with classical post-starburst galaxies shows that both populations show similar signatures of bulge growth, and we suggest that the defining characteristic of post-starburst galaxies is the efficiency of their bulge growth rather than a particular formation mechanism.

AB  - Does the ``blazar sequence'' exist, or is it a result of a selection effect, due to the difficulty in measuring the redshifts of blazars with both high synchrotron peak frequencies (gsim 1015 Hz) and luminosities (gsim 1046 erg s-1)? We explore this question with a sample of blazars from the second catalog of active galactic nuclei from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The Compton dominance, the ratio of the peak of the Compton to the synchrotron peak luminosities, is essentially a redshift-independent quantity and thus crucial to answering this question. We find that a correlation exists between Compton dominance and the peak frequency of the synchrotron component for all blazars in the sample, including ones with unknown redshift. We then construct a simple model to explain the blazar properties in our sample, where the difference between sources is due to only the magnetic field of the blazar jet emitting region, the external radiation field energy density, and the jet angle to the line of sight, with the magnetic field strength and external energy density being correlated. This model can reproduce the trends of the blazars in the sample and predicts that blazars may be discovered in the future with high synchrotron peak frequencies and luminosities. At the same time the simple model reproduces the lack of high-synchrotron-peaked blazars with high Compton dominances (gsim 1).

AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate a new method for fitting galaxy profiles which makes use of the full multiwavelength data provided by modern large optical-near-infrared imaging surveys. We present a new version of GALAPAGOS, which utilizes a recently developed multiwavelength version of GALFIT, and enables the automated measurement of wavelength-dependent Sérsic profile parameters for very large samples of galaxies. Our new technique is extensively tested to assess the reliability of both pieces of software, GALFIT and GALAPAGOS on both real ugrizY JHK imaging data from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey and simulated data made to the same specifications. We find that fitting galaxy light profiles with multiwavelength data increases the stability and accuracy of the measured parameters, and hence produces more complete and meaningful multiwavelength photometry than has been available previously. The improvement is particularly significant for magnitudes in low-S/N bands and for structural parameters like half-light radius re and Sérsic index n for which a prior is used by constraining these parameters to a polynomial as a function of wavelength. This allows the fitting routines to push the magnitude of galaxies for which sensible values can be derived to fainter limits. The technique utilizes a smooth transition of galaxy parameters with wavelength, creating more physically meaningful transitions than single-band fitting and allows accurate interpolation between passbands, perfect for derivation of rest-frame values.

AB  - We report on spectroscopic observations covering most of the 475 BL Lacs in the second Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Including archival measurements (correcting several erroneous literature values) we now have spectroscopic redshifts for 44% of the BL Lacs. We establish firm lower redshift limits via intervening absorption systems and statistical lower limits via searches for host galaxies for an additional 51% of the sample leaving only 5% of the BL Lacs unconstrained. The new redshifts raise the median spectroscopic z from 0.23 to 0.33 and include redshifts as large as z = 2.471. Spectroscopic redshift minima from intervening absorbers have z= 0.70, showing a substantial fraction at large z and arguing against strong negative evolution. We find that detected BL Lac hosts are bright ellipticals with black hole masses M * ~ 108.5 - 109, substantially larger than the mean of optical AGNs and LAT Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar samples. A slow increase in M * with z may be due to selection bias. We find that the power-law dominance of the optical spectrum extends to extreme values, but this does not strongly correlate with the gamma-ray properties, suggesting that strong beaming is the primary cause of the range in continuum dominance.

AB  - We show that direct detection and measurement of the vertically thickened parts of bars (so-called `boxy' or `peanut-shaped' bulges) are possible not only for edge-on galaxies but also for galaxies with moderate inclinations (i < 70$\,^\circ$), and that examples are relatively common in the nearby Universe. The analysis of a sample of 78 nearby, moderately inclined (i ≲ 65$\,^\circ$) early-type (S0-Sb) barred galaxies shows that the isophotal signature of the box/peanut can usually be detected for inclinations as low as i ˜ 40$\,^\circ$ - and in exceptional cases down to i ˜ 30$\,^\circ$. In agreement with the predictions from N-body simulations, the signature is most easily detectable when the bar's position angle is within ˜50$\,^\circ$ of the galaxy major axis; in particular, galaxies where the bar lies very close to the minor axis do not show the signature clearly or at all. For galaxies with i = 40$\,^\circ$-65$\,^\circ$ and relative angles <45$\,^\circ$, we find evidence for the signature ≈2/3 of the time; the true frequency of box/peanut structures in bars may be higher. Comparison with N-body models also allows us to link observed photometric morphology with 3D physical structures, and thus estimate the relative sizes of box/peanut structures and bars. For our local sample, we find that box/peanut structures range in radial size (measured along the bar major axis) from 0.4 to 3.8 kpc (mean =1.5 $\pm$ 0.9 kpc) and span 0.26-0.58 of the bar length (mean of 0.38 $\pm$ 0.08). This is a clear observational confirmation that when bars thicken, it is not the entire bar which does so, but only the inner part. This technique can also be used to identify galaxies with bars which have not vertically thickened. We suggest that NGC 3049 and IC 676 may be particularly good examples, and that the fraction of S0-Sb bars which lack box/peanut structures is at least ˜13 per cent.

AB  - Starting from the assumption that there is a large population (>=108) of stellar-mass isolated black holes (IBH) distributed throughout our Galaxy, we consider the detectable signatures of accretion from the interstellar medium (ISM) that may be associated with such a population. We simulate the nearby (radius 250 pc) part of this population, corresponding to the closest ˜35 000 black holes, using current best estimates of the mass distribution of stellar-mass black holes combined with two models for the velocity distribution of stellar-mass IBH which bracket likely possibilities. We distribute this population of objects appropriately within the different phases of the ISM and calculate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate, modified by a further dimensionless efficiency parameter lambda. Assuming a simple prescription for radiatively inefficient accretion at low Eddington ratios, we calculate the X-ray luminosity of these objects, and similarly estimate the radio luminosity from relations found empirically for black holes accreting at low rates. The latter assumption depends crucially on whether or not the IBH accrete from the ISM in a manner which is axisymmetric enough to produce jets. Comparing the predicted X-ray fluxes with limits from hard X-ray surveys, we conclude that either the Bondi-Hoyle efficiency parameter lambda is rather small (<=0.01), the velocities of the IBH are rather high, or some combination of both. The predicted radio flux densities correspond to a population of objects which, while below current survey limits, should be detectable with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Converting the simulated space velocities into proper motions, we further demonstrate that such IBH could be identified as faint high proper motion radio sources in SKA surveys.

AB  - In order to understand the physical mechanisms at work during the formation of massive early-type galaxies, we performed six zoomed hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of haloes in the mass range 4.3 × 1012 <= Mvir <= 8.0 × 1013 M&sun; at z = 0, using the Adaptive Mesh Refinement code RAMSES. These simulations explore the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN), through jets powered by the accretion on to supermassive black holes on the formation of massive elliptical galaxies. In the absence of AGN feedback, large amounts of stars accumulate in the central galaxies to form overly massive, blue, compact and rotation-dominated galaxies. Powerful AGN jets transform the central galaxies into red extended and dispersion-dominated galaxies. This morphological transformation of disc galaxies into elliptical galaxies is driven by the efficient quenching of the in situ star formation due to AGN feedback, which transform these galaxies into systems built up by accretion. For galaxies mainly formed by accretion, the proportion of stars deposited farther away from the centre increases, and galaxies have larger sizes. The accretion is also directly responsible for randomizing the stellar orbits, increasing the amount of dispersion over rotation of stars as a function of time. Finally, we find that our galaxies simulated with AGN feedback better match the observed scaling laws, such as the size-mass, velocity dispersion-mass, Fundamental Plane relations and slope of the total density profiles at z ˜ 0, from dynamical and strong lensing constraints.

AB  - Bulges are not just elliptical subgalaxies situated in the centers of large spirals, though it might seem so from their ages and chemistry. In fact, bulge kinematics have been known to be different since the first long slit spectra were obtained. M31 presents the best opportunity to investigate all the issues of the stellar populations of bulges. This review collects the array of probing data that has been accumulated during the last decade. But the intriguing question 'how did it form like this?' remains.

AB  - Using galaxy data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8, I explore whether the concentration index is a good morphological classification tool and find that a reasonable sample of pure late-type galaxies can be constructed with the choice of the r-band concentration index ci=2.85. The opposite is not true, however, due to the fairly high contamination of an early-type sample by late-type galaxies. In such an analysis, the influence of selection effects is less important. To disentangle correlations of the morphology and concentration index with stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific star formation rate (SSFR) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, I investigate correlations of the concentration index with these properties at a fixed morphology and correlations of the morphology with these properties at a fixed concentration index. It is found that at a fixed morphology, high-concentration galaxies are preferentially more massive and have a lower SFR and SSFR than low-concentration galaxies, whereas at a fixed concentration index, elliptical galaxies are preferentially more massive and have a lower SFR and SSFR than spiral galaxies. This result shows that the stellar mass, SFR and SSFR of a galaxy are correlated with its concentration index as well as its morphology. In addition, I note that AGNs are preferentially found in more concentrated galaxies only in the sample of spiral galaxies.

AB  - Azimuthal age/color gradients across spiral arms are a signature of long-lived spirals. From a sample of 19 normal (or weakly barred) spirals where we have previously found azimuthal age/color gradient candidates, 13 objects were further selected if a two-armed grand-design pattern survived in a surface density stellar mass map. Mass maps were obtained from optical and near-infrared imaging, by comparison with a Monte Carlo library of stellar population synthesis models that allowed us to obtain the mass-to-light ratio in the J band, (M/L) J , as a function of (g - i) versus (i - J) color. The selected spirals were analyzed with Fourier methods in search of other signatures of long-lived modes related to the gradients, such as the gradient divergence toward corotation, and the behavior of the phase angle of the two-armed spiral in different wavebands, as expected from theory. The results show additional signatures of long-lived spirals in at least 50% of the objects.

AB  - We analyze the clump population of the spiral galaxy Sp 1149 at redshift 1.5. Located behind the galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223, Sp 1149 has been significantly magnified allowing us to study the galaxy on physical scales down to ~100 pc. The galaxy cluster frame is among the targets of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH), an ongoing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Multi-Cycle Treasury program. We have used the publicly available multi-band imaging data set to reconstruct the spectral energy distributions of the clumps in Sp 1149, and derive, by means of stellar evolutionary models, their physical properties. We found that 40% of the clumps observed in Sp 1149 are older than 30 Myr and can be as old as 300 Myr. These are also the more massive (luminous) clumps in the galaxy. Among the complexes in the local reference sample, the star-forming knots in luminous blue compact galaxies could be considered progenitor analogs of these long-lived clumps. The remaining 60% of clumps have colors comparable to local cluster complexes, suggesting a similar young age. We observe that the Sp 1149 clumps follow the MvpropR 2 relation similar to local cluster complexes, suggesting similar formation mechanisms although they may have different initial conditions (e.g., higher gas surface densities). We suggest that the galaxy is experiencing a slow decline in star formation rate and a likely transitional phase toward a more quiescent star formation mode. The older clumps have survived between 6 and 20 dynamical times and are all located at projected distances smaller than 4 kpc from the center. Their current location suggests migration toward the center and the possibility of being the building blocks of the bulge. On the other hand, the dynamical timescale of the younger clumps is significantly shorter, meaning that they are quite close to their birthplace. We show that the clumps of Sp 1149 may account for the expected metal-rich globular cluster population usually associated with the bulge and thick disk components of local spirals.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program 12065.

AB  - Using the spectra of a sample of ~28,000 nearby obscured active galaxies from Data Release 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we probe the connection between active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and star formation over a range of radial scales in the host galaxy. We use the extinction-corrected luminosity of the [O III] 5007 Å line as a proxy of intrinsic AGN power and supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rate. The star formation rates (SFRs) are taken from the MPA-JHU value-added catalog and are measured through the 3'' SDSS aperture. We construct matched samples of galaxies covering a range in redshifts. With increasing redshift, the projected aperture size encompasses increasing amounts of the host galaxy. This allows us to trace the radial distribution of star formation as a function of AGN luminosity. We find that the star formation becomes more centrally concentrated with increasing AGN luminosity and Eddington ratio. This implies that such circumnuclear star formation is associated with AGN activity, and that it increasingly dominates over omnipresent disk star formation at higher AGN luminosities, placing critical constraints on theoretical models that link host galaxy star formation and SMBH fueling. We parameterize this relationship and find that the star formation on radial scales <1.7 kpc, when including a constant disk component, has a sub-linear dependence on SMBH accretion rate: SFR \propto M^0.36, suggesting that angular momentum transfer through the disk limits accretion efficiency rather than the supply from stellar mass loss.

AB  - We present a statistical study of the environments of massive galaxies in four redshift bins between z = 0.04 and z = 1.6, using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey. We measure the projected radial distribution of galaxies in cylinders around a constant number density selected sample of massive galaxies and utilize a statistical subtraction of contaminating sources. Our analysis shows that massive primary galaxies typically live in group halos and are surrounded by 2-3 satellites with masses more than one-tenth of the primary galaxy mass. The cumulative stellar mass in these satellites roughly equals the mass of the primary galaxy itself. We further find that the radial number density profile of galaxies around massive primaries has not evolved significantly in either slope or overall normalization in the past 9.5 Gyr. A simplistic interpretation of this result can be taken as evidence for a lack of mergers in the studied groups and as support for a static evolution model of halos containing massive primaries. Alternatively, there exists a tight balance between mergers and accretion of new satellites such that the overall distribution of galaxies in and around the halo is preserved. The latter interpretation is supported by a comparison to a semi-analytic model, which shows a similar constant average satellite distribution over the same redshift range.

AB  - The fractions and dimension of bars, rings and lenses are studied in the near-infrared (IR) S0 galaxy survey, which is a sample of ˜200 early-type disc galaxies, mainly S0s. We find evidence that multiple lenses in some barred S0s are related to bar resonances in a similar manner as the inner and outer rings, for which the outer/inner length ratio is ˜2. Inner lenses in the non-barred galaxies normalized to galaxy diameter are clearly smaller than those in the barred systems. Interestingly, these small lenses in the non-barred galaxies have similar sizes as barlenses (lens-like structures embedded in a bar), and therefore might actually be barlenses in former barred galaxies, in which the outer, more elongated bar component has been destroyed. We also find that fully developed inner lenses are on average a factor of 1.3 larger than bars, whereas inner rings have similar sizes as bars. The fraction of inner lenses is found to be constant in all family classes (A, AB, B). Nuclear bars appear most frequently among the weakly barred (AB) galaxies, which are consistent with the theoretical models by Maciejewski & Athanassoula. Similar-sized bars as the nuclear bars were detected in seven `non-barred' S0s. Galaxy luminosity does not uniquely define the sizes of bars or bar-related structures, neither is there any upper limit in galaxy luminosity for bar formation. Although all the family classes cover the same range of galaxy luminosity, the non-barred (A) galaxies are on average 0.6 mag brighter than the strongly barred (B) systems. Overall, our results are consistent with the idea that bars play an important role in the formation of the structure components of galaxies. The fact that multiple lenses are common in S0s, and that at least the inner lenses can have very old stellar populations, implies that the last destructive merger or major gas accretion event, must have taken place at a fairly high redshift.

AB  - We have recently proposed a new simplified scenario where blazars are classified as flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) or BL Lacs according to the prescriptions of unified schemes, and to a varying combination of Doppler-boosted radiation from the jet, emission from the accretion disc, the broad line region and light from the host galaxy. Here we extend our approach, previously applied to radio and X-ray surveys, to the gamma-ray band and, through detailed Monte Carlo simulations, compare our predictions to Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) survey data. Our simulations are in remarkable agreement with the overall observational results, including the percentages of BL Lacs and FSRQs, the fraction of redshift-less objects and the redshift, synchrotron peak and gamma-ray spectral index distributions. The strength and large scatter of the oft-debated observed gamma-ray-radio flux density correlation are also reproduced. In addition, we predict that almost 3/4 of Fermi-LAT BL Lacs, and basically all of those without redshift determination, are actually FSRQs with their emission lines swamped by the non-thermal continuum and as such should be considered. Finally, several of the currently unassociated high Galactic latitude Fermi sources are expected to be radio-faint blazars displaying a pure elliptical galaxy optical spectrum.

AB  - High-volume feature-rich data sets are becoming the bread-and-butter of 21st century astronomy but present significant challenges to scientific discovery. In particular, identifying scientifically significant relationships between sets of parameters is non-trivial. Similar problems in biological and geosciences have led to the development of systems which can explore large parameter spaces and identify potentially interesting sets of associations. In this paper, we describe the application of automated discovery systems of relationships to astronomical data sets, focusing on an evolutionary programming technique and an information-theory technique. We demonstrate their use with classical astronomical relationships - the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and the Fundamental Plane of elliptical galaxies. We also show how they work with the issue of binary classification which is relevant to the next generation of large synoptic sky surveys, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). We find that comparable results to more familiar techniques, such as decision trees, are achievable. Finally, we consider the reality of the relationships discovered and how this can be used for feature selection and extraction.

AB  - We use the large COSMOS sample of galaxies to study in an internally self-consistent way the change in the number densities of quenched early-type galaxies (Q-ETGs) of a given size over the redshift interval 0.2 < z < 1 in order to study the claimed size evolution of these galaxies. In a stellar mass bin at 1010.5 < M galaxy < 1011 M ☉, we see no change in the number density of compact Q-ETGs over this redshift range, while in a higher mass bin at >1011 M ☉, where we would expect merging to be more significant, we find a small decrease, by ~30%. In both mass bins, the increase of the median sizes of Q-ETGs with time is primarily caused by the addition to the size function of larger and more diffuse Q-ETGs. At all masses, compact Q-ETGs become systematically redder toward later epochs, with a (U -- V) color difference which is consistent with a passive evolution of their stellar populations, indicating that they are a stable population that does not appreciably evolve in size. We find furthermore, at all epochs, that the larger Q-ETGs (at least in the lower mass bin) have average rest-frame colors that are systematically bluer than those of the more compact Q-ETGs, suggesting that the former are indeed younger than the latter. The idea that new, large, Q-ETGs are responsible for the observed growth in the median size of the population at a given mass is also supported by analysis of the sizes and number of the star-forming galaxies that are expected to be the progenitors of the new Q-ETGs over the same period. In the low mass bin, the new Q-ETGs appear to have ~30% smaller half-light radii than their star-forming progenitors. This is likely due to the fading of their disks after they cease star formation. Comparison with higher redshifts shows that the median size of newly quenched galaxies roughly scales, at constant mass, as (1 + z)--1. We conclude that the dominant cause of the size evolution seen in the Q-ETG population is that the average sizes and thus stellar densities of individual Q-ETGs roughly scale with the average density of the universe at the time when they were quenched, and that subsequent size changes in individual objects, through merging or other processes, are of secondary importance, especially at masses below 1011 M ☉.

AB  - We have performed a series of chemodynamical simulations of barred disc galaxies. Our goal is to determine the physical processes responsible for the increase in the central gas-phase metallicity and of the central star formation rate (SFR) observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). All simulations start with an axisymmetric distribution of stars and gas, embedded into a spherical dark matter halo. We define a 2 kpc diameter central aperture to approximate the integrated spectroscopic fibre measurements from the SDSS. The chemical evolution observed within this central region depends critically upon the relative size of the bar and the aperture, which evolves strongly with time. At t ˜ 0.5 Gyr, a strong bar forms via a disc instability, whose length is considerably longer than the 2 kpc aperture. The stars and gas lose angular momentum and follow elongated orbits that cause an intense mixing of the gas between the central region and its surroundings. During the next 1.5 Gyr, the orbits of the stars inside the bar do not evolve much, but the orbits of the gas contract significantly until the entire gas bar is contained in the 2 kpc aperture, resulting in a net flux of gas into the central region. During this period, the metallicity in the central region increases steadily, and this enrichment is dominated by metal-rich gas that is flowing into the central region. The main result of this work is therefore that the observed enrichment in the centres of barred galaxies is not dominated by in situ enrichment by stars formed in the centre. Rather, star formation occurs along the full length of the bar, much of which occurs initially outside the 2 kpc aperture. About 50 per cent of the metals that end up in the central region originate from this extended bar-long star formation, but flow into the central region due to loss of angular momentum. The effect is less significant for iron because the delay for the onset of Type Ia supernovae leaves less time for mixing. Still, there is a significant increase in [Fe/H] before the central stars contribute to in situ enrichment. Eventually, as the orbits of the gas inside the bar contract, they fall completely inside the central region, and only then the central region can be regarded as a closed-box system. However, by that time, most of the metal enrichment in the central region has already taken place. We conclude that there is no direct connection between central SFR and central metallicity. The central metallicity does not originate exclusively from central stars. Instead, the global SFR (especially along the bar) and the large-scale flow of enriched gas play a major role.

AB  - The fraction of cluster galaxies that host luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is an important probe of AGN fueling processes, the cold interstellar medium at the centers of galaxies, and how tightly black holes and galaxies co-evolve. We present a new measurement of the AGN fraction in a sample of 13 clusters of galaxies (M >= 1014 M &sun;) at 1 < z < 1.5 selected from the Spitzer/IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey, as well as the field fraction in the immediate vicinity of these clusters, and combine these data with measurements from the literature to quantify the relative evolution of cluster and field AGN from the present to z ~ 3. We estimate that the cluster AGN fraction at 1 < z < 1.5 is f_A = 3.0^+2.4_-1.4% for AGNs with a rest-frame, hard X-ray luminosity greater than L  X, H  >= 1044 erg s-1. This fraction is measured relative to all cluster galaxies more luminous than M^*_3.6(z) + 1, where M^*_3.6(z) is the absolute magnitude of the break in the galaxy luminosity function at the cluster redshift in the IRAC 3.6 mum bandpass. The cluster AGN fraction is 30 times greater than the 3sigma upper limit on the value for AGNs of similar luminosity at z ~ 0.25, as well as more than an order of magnitude greater than the AGN fraction at z ~ 0.75. AGNs with L  X, H  >= 1043 erg s-1 exhibit similarly pronounced evolution with redshift. In contrast to the local universe, where the luminous AGN fraction is higher in the field than in clusters, the X-ray and MIR-selected AGN fractions in the field and clusters are consistent at 1 < z < 1.5. This is evidence that the cluster AGN population has evolved more rapidly than the field population from z ~ 1.5 to the present. This environment-dependent AGN evolution mimics the more rapid evolution of star-forming galaxies in clusters relative to the field.

AB  - Large-scale structures (LSSs) out to z < 3.0 are measured in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) using extremely accurate photometric redshifts (photoz). The Ks -band-selected sample (from Ultra-Vista) is comprised of 155,954 galaxies. Two techniques---adaptive smoothing and Voronoi tessellation---are used to estimate the environmental densities within 127 redshift slices. Approximately 250 statistically significant overdense structures are identified out to z = 3.0 with shapes varying from elongated filamentary structures to more circularly symmetric concentrations. We also compare the densities derived for COSMOS with those based on semi-analytic predictions for a LambdaCDM simulation and find excellent overall agreement between the mean densities as a function of redshift and the range of densities. The galaxy properties (stellar mass, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and star formation rates (SFRs)) are strongly correlated with environmental density and redshift, particularly at z < 1.0-1.2. Classifying the spectral type of each galaxy using the rest-frame b - i color (from the photoz SED fitting), we find a strong correlation of early-type galaxies (E-Sa) with high-density environments, while the degree of environmental segregation varies systematically with redshift out to z ~ 1.3. In the highest density regions, 80% of the galaxies are early types at z = 0.2 compared to only 20% at z = 1.5. The SFRs and the star formation timescales exhibit clear environmental correlations. At z > 0.8, the SFR density is uniformly distributed over all environmental density percentiles, while at lower redshifts the dominant contribution is shifted to galaxies in lower density environments.

AB  - The stellar kinematics of the spheroids and discs of S0 galaxies contain clues to their formation histories. Unfortunately, it is difficult to disentangle the two components and to recover their stellar kinematics in the faint outer parts of the galaxies using conventional absorption line spectroscopy. This paper therefore presents the stellar kinematics of six S0 galaxies derived from observations of planetary nebulae, obtained using the Planetary Nebula Spectrograph. To separate the kinematics of the two components, we use a maximum-likelihood method that combines the discrete kinematic data with a photometric component decomposition. The results of this analysis reveal that: the discs of S0 galaxies are rotationally supported; however, the amount of random motion in these discs is systematically higher than in comparable spiral galaxies; and the S0s lie around one magnitude below the Tully-Fisher relation for spiral galaxies, while their spheroids lie nearly one magnitude above the Faber-Jackson relation for ellipticals. All of these findings are consistent with a scenario in which spirals are converted into S0s through a process of mild harassment or `pestering,' with their discs somewhat heated and their spheroid somewhat enhanced by the conversion process. In such a scenario, one might expect the properties of S0s to depend on environment. We do not see such an effect in this fairly small sample, although any differences would be diluted by the fact that the current location does not necessarily reflect the environment in which the transformation occurred. Similar observations of larger samples probing a broader range of environments, coupled with more detailed modelling of the transformation process to match the wide range of parameters that we have shown can now be measured, should take us from these first steps to the definitive answer as to how S0 galaxies form.

The origins of these discoveries are examined and it is demonstrated that, in each case, a great deal of supporting evidence was already in place.  In some cases the discoveries had either already been made, or competing versions were not adopted for complex scientific and sociological reasons.

AB  - Segue 2, discovered by Belokurov et al., is a galaxy with a luminosity of only 900 L &sun;. We present Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of 25 members of Segue 2---a threefold increase in spectroscopic sample size. The velocity dispersion is too small to be measured with our data. The upper limit with 90% (95%) confidence is sigma v  < 2.2 (2.6) km s-1, the most stringent limit for any galaxy. The corresponding limit on the mass within the three-dimensional half-light radius (46 pc) is M 1/2 < 1.5 (2.1) × 105 M &sun;. Segue 2 is the least massive galaxy known. We identify Segue 2 as a galaxy rather than a star cluster based on the wide dispersion in [Fe/H] (from -2.85 to -1.33) among the member stars. The stars' [alpha/Fe] ratios decline with increasing [Fe/H], indicating that Segue 2 retained Type Ia supernova ejecta despite its presently small mass and that star formation lasted for at least 100 Myr. The mean metallicity, lang[Fe/H]rang = -2.22 $\pm$ 0.13 (about the same as the Ursa Minor galaxy, 330 times more luminous than Segue 2), is higher than expected from the luminosity-metallicity relation defined by more luminous dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way. Segue 2 may be the barest remnant of a tidally stripped, Ursa Minor-sized galaxy. If so, it is the best example of an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy that came to be ultra-faint through tidal stripping. Alternatively, Segue 2 could have been born in a very low mass dark matter subhalo (v max < 10 km s-1), below the atomic hydrogen cooling limit.  The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.

AB  - We perform photometric analyses of a bright early-type galaxy sample with 2949 galaxies (Mr < --22.5 mag) in the redshift range of 0.05-0.15, drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 with morphological classification from Galaxy Zoo 1. We measure the Petrosian and isophotal magnitudes, as well as the corresponding half-light radius for each galaxy. We find that for the brightest galaxies (Mr < --23 mag), our Petrosian magnitudes and isophotal magnitudes to 25 mag arcsec--2 and 1% of the sky brightness are on average 0.16 mag, 0.20 mag, and 0.26 mag brighter than the SDSS Petrosian values, respectively. In the first case, the underestimations are caused by overestimations in the sky background by the SDSS PHOTO algorithm, while the latter two are also due to deeper photometry. Similarly, the typical half-light radii (r 50) measured by the SDSS algorithm are smaller than our measurements. As a result, the bright end of the r-band luminosity function is found to decline more slowly than previous works. Our measured luminosity densities at the bright end are more than one order of magnitude higher than those of Blanton et al., and the stellar mass densities at M * ~ 5 × 1011 M ☉ and M * ~ 1012 M ☉ are a few tenths and a factor of a few higher than those of Bernardi et al. These results may significantly alleviate the tension in the assembly of massive galaxies between observations and predictions of the hierarchical structure formation model.

AB  - In this paper we present a detailed study of the structures and morphologies of a sample of 1188 massive galaxies with M* >= 1010 M&sun; between redshifts z = 1 and 3 within the Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) region of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) field. Using this sample we determine how galaxy structure and morphology evolve with time, and investigate the nature of galaxy structure at high redshift. We visually classify our sample into discs, ellipticals and peculiar systems and correct for redshift effects on these classifications through simulations. We find significant evolution in the fractions of galaxies at a given visual classification as a function of redshift. The peculiar population is dominant at z > 2 with a substantial spheroid population, and a negligible disc population. We compute the transition redshift, ztrans, where the combined fraction of spheroidal and disc galaxies is equal to that of the peculiar population, as ztrans = 1.86 $\pm$ 0.62 for galaxies in our stellar mass range. We find that this transition changes as a function of stellar mass, with Hubble-type galaxies becoming dominant at higher redshifts for higher mass galaxies (ztrans = 2.22 $\pm$ 0.82), than for the lower mass galaxies (ztrans = 1.73 $\pm$ 0.57). Higher mass galaxies become morphologically settled before their lower mass counterparts, a form of morphological downsizing. We furthermore compare our visual classifications with the Sérsic index, the concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness (CAS) parameters, star formation rate and rest-frame U - B colour. We find links between the colour of a galaxy, its star formation rate and how extended or peculiar it appears. Finally, we discuss the negligible z > 2 disc fraction based on visual morphologies and speculate that this is an effect of forming disc appearing peculiar through processes such as violent disc instabilities or mergers. We conclude that to properly define and measure high-redshift morphology and structure a new and more exact classification scheme is needed.

AB  - We examine the hypothesis that mergers and close encounters between galaxies can fuel active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by increasing the rate at which gas accretes toward the central black hole. We compare the clustering of galaxies around radio-loud AGNs with the clustering around a population of radio-quiet galaxies with similar masses, colors, and luminosities. Our catalog contains 2178 elliptical radio galaxies with flux densities greater than 2.8 mJy at 1.4 GHz from the Six Degree Field Galaxy Survey. We find tentative evidence that radio AGNs with more than 200 times the median radio power have, on average, more close (r < 160 kpc) companions than their radio-quiet counterparts, suggesting that mergers play a role in forming the most powerful radio galaxies. For ellipticals of fixed stellar mass, the radio power is neither a function of large-scale environment nor halo mass, consistent with the radio powers of ellipticals varying by orders of magnitude over billions of years.

AB  - Pressure-regulated star formation is a simple variant on the usual supernova-regulated star formation efficiency that controls the global star formation rate as a function of cold gas content in star-forming galaxies, and accounts for the Schmidt-Kennicutt law in both nearby and distant galaxies. Inclusion of active galactic nucleus (AGN) induced pressure, by jets and/or winds that flow back onto a gas-rich disk, can lead, under some circumstances, to significantly enhanced star formation rates, especially at high redshift and most likely followed by the more widely accepted phase of star formation quenching. Simple expressions are derived that relate supermassive black hole growth, star formation, and outflow rates. The ratios of black hole to spheroid mass and of both black hole accretion and outflow rates to star formation rate are predicted as a function of time. I suggest various tests of the AGN-triggered star formation hypothesis.

AB  - We report the detection of a 22 GHz water maser line in the nearest (D ~ 3.8 Mpc) radio galaxy Centaurus A (Cen A) using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The line is centered at a velocity of ~960 km s-1, which is redshifted by about 415 km s-1 from the systemic velocity. Such an offset, as well as the width of ~120 km s-1, could be consistent with either a nuclear maser arising from an accretion disk of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), or with a jet maser that is emitted from the material that is shocked near the base of the jet in Cen A. The best spatial resolution of our ATCA data constrains the origin of the maser feature within <3 pc of the SMBH. The maser exhibits an isotropic luminosity of ~1 L &sun;, which classifies it as a kilomaser, and appears to be variable on timescales of months. A kilomaser can also be emitted by shocked gas in star-forming regions. Given the small projected distance from the core, the large offset from systemic velocity, and the smoothness of the line feature, we conclude that a jet maser line emitted by shocked gas around the base of the active galactic nucleus is the most likely explanation. For this scenario we can infer a minimum density of the radio jet of >~ 10 cm-3, which indicates substantial mass entrainment of surrounding gas into the propagating jet material.

AB  - Galaxies grow primarily via accretion-driven star formation in discs and merger-driven growth of bulges. These processes are implicit in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation, with bulge growth in particular relating directly to the hierarchical build-up of haloes and their galaxies. In this paper, we consider several implementations of two semi-analytical models. Focusing on implementations in which bulges are formed during mergers only, we examine the fractions of elliptical galaxies and both passive and star-forming disc galaxies as functions of stellar and halo mass, for central and satellite systems. This is compared to an observational cross-matched Sloan Digital Sky Survey+Third Reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies z ˜ 0 sample of galaxies with accurate visual morphological classifications and M* > 1010.5 M&sun;. The models qualitatively reproduce the observed increase of elliptical fraction with stellar mass, and with halo mass for central galaxies, supporting the idea that observed ellipticals form during major mergers. However, the overall elliptical fraction produced by the models is much too high compared with the z ˜ 0 data. Since the `passive' - i.e. non-star-forming - fractions are approximately reproduced, and since the fraction which are star-forming disc galaxies is also reproduced, the problem is that the models overproduce ellipticals at the expense of passive S0 and spiral galaxies. Bulge growth implementations (tuned to reproduce simulations) which allow the survival of residual discs in major mergers still destroy too much of the disc. Increasing the lifetime of satellites, or allowing significant disc regrowth around merger remnants, merely increases the fraction of star-forming disc galaxies. Instead, it seems necessary to reduce the mass ratios of merging galaxies, so that most mergers produce modest bulge growth in disc galaxy remnants instead of ellipticals. This could be a natural consequence of tidal stripping of stars from infalling satellite galaxies, a process not considered in our models. However, a high efficiency of quenching during and/or subsequent to minor mergers is still required to keep the passive fraction high.

AB  - Emission from astronomical jets extend over the entire spectral band: from radio to the TeV gamma-rays. This implies that various radiative processes are taking place in different regions along jets. Understanding the origin of the emission is crucial in understanding the physical conditions inside jets, as well as basic physical questions such as jet launching mechanism, particle acceleration and jet composition. In this chapter I discuss various radiative mechanisms, focusing on jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries (XRB) environment. I discuss various models in use in interpreting the data, and the insights they provide.

AB  - By modelling the axis ratio distribution of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 galaxies, we find the intrinsic 3D shapes of spirals and ellipticals. We use morphological information from the Galaxy Zoo project and assume a non-parametric distribution intrinsic of shapes, while taking into account dust extinction. We measure the dust extinction of the full sample of spiral galaxies and find a smaller value than previous estimations, with an edge-on extinction of E_0 = 0.284^+0.015_-0.026 in the SDSS r band. We also find that the distribution of minor to major axis ratio has a mean value of 0.267 $\pm$ 0.009, slightly larger than previous estimates mainly due to the lower extinction used; the same affects the circularity of galactic discs, which are found to be less round in shape than in previous studies, with a mean ellipticity of 0.215 $\pm$ 0.013. For elliptical galaxies, we find that the minor to major axis ratio, with a mean value of 0.584 $\pm$ 0.006, is larger than previous estimations due to the removal of spiral interlopers present in samples with morphological information from photometric profiles. These interlopers are removed when selecting ellipticals using Galaxy Zoo data. We find that the intrinsic shapes of galaxies and their dust extinction vary with absolute magnitude, colour and physical size. We find that bright elliptical galaxies are more spherical than faint ones, a trend that is also present with galaxy size, and that there is no dependence of elliptical galaxy shape with colour. For spiral galaxies, we find that the reddest ones have higher dust extinction as expected, due to the fact that this reddening is mainly due to dust. We also find that the thickness of discs increases with luminosity and size, and that brighter, smaller and redder galaxies have less round discs.

AB  - We discuss the state of the assembly of the Hubble sequence in the mix of bright galaxies at redshift 1.4 < z <= 2.5 with a large sample of 1671 galaxies down to H AB ~ 26, selected from the HST/ACS and WFC3 images of the GOODS-South field obtained as part of the GOODS and CANDELS observations. We investigate the relationship between the star formation properties and morphology using various parametric diagnostics, such as the Sérsic light profile, Gini (G), M 20, concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and multiplicity (Psi) parameters. Our sample clearly separates into massive, red, and passive galaxies versus less massive, blue, and star-forming ones, and this dichotomy correlates very well with the galaxies' morphological properties. Star-forming galaxies show a broad variety of morphological features, including clumpy structures and bulges mixed with faint low surface brightness features, generally characterized by disky-type light profiles. Passively evolving galaxies, on the other hand, very often have compact light distribution and morphology typical of today's spheroidal systems. We also find that artificially redshifted local galaxies have a similar distribution with z ~ 2 galaxies in a G-M 20 plane. Visual inspection between the rest-frame optical and UV images show that there is a generally weak morphological k-correction for galaxies at z ~ 2, but the comparison with non-parametric measures show that galaxies in the rest-frame UV are somewhat clumpier than rest-frame optical. Similar general trends are observed in the local universe among massive galaxies, suggesting that the backbone of the Hubble sequence was already in place at z ~ 2.

AB  - A very simple physical model of galaxies is one in which the formation of stars is instantaneously regulated by the mass of gas in a reservoir with mass loss scaling with the star-formation rate (SFR). This model links together three different aspects of the evolving galaxy population: (1) the cosmic time evolution of the specific star-formation rate (sSFR) relative to the growth of halos, (2) the gas-phase metallicities across the galaxy population and over cosmic time, and (3) the ratio of the stellar to dark matter mass of halos. The gas regulator is defined by the gas consumption timescale (epsilo--1) and the mass loading lambda of the wind outflow lambda·SFR. The simplest regulator, in which epsilo and lambda are constant, sets the sSFR equal to exactly the specific accretion rate of the galaxy; more realistic situations lead to an sSFR that is perturbed from this precise relation. Because the gas consumption timescale is shorter than the timescale on which the system evolves, the metallicity Z is set primarily by the instantaneous operation of the regulator system rather than by the past history of the system. The metallicity of the gas reservoir depends on epsilo, lambda, and sSFR, and the regulator system therefore naturally produces a Z(m star, SFR) relation if epsilo and lambda depend on the stellar mass m star. Furthermore, this relation will be the same at all epochs unless the parameters epsilo and lambda themselves change with time. A so-called fundamental metallicity relation is naturally produced by these conditions. The overall mass-metallicity relation Z(m star) directly provides the fraction f star(m star) of incoming baryons that are being transformed into stars. The observed Z(m star) relation of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies implies a strong dependence of stellar mass on halo mass that reconciles the different faint-end slopes of the stellar and halo mass functions in standard LambdaCDM models. The observed relation also boosts the sSFR relative to the specific accretion rate and produces a different dependence on mass, both of which are observed. The derived Z(m star, SFR) relation for the regulator system is fit to published Z(m star, SFR) data for the SDSS galaxy population, yielding epsilo and lambda as functions of m star. The fitted epsilo is consistent with observed molecular gas-depletion timescales in galaxies (allowing for the extra atomic gas), while the fitted lambda is also reasonable. The gas-regulator model also successfully reproduces the Z(m star) metallicities of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2. One consequence of this analysis is that it suggests that the m star-m halo relation is established by baryonic processes operating within galaxies, and that a significant fraction (40%) of baryons coming into the halos are being processed through the galaxies. This fraction may be more or less constant. The success of the gas-regulator model in simultaneously explaining many diverse observed relations over the 0 < z < 2 interval suggests that the evolution of galaxies is governed by simple physics that form the basis for this model.

AB  - We use the chemical evolution predictions of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with our latest theoretical stellar population synthesis, photoionization, and shock models to predict the strong line evolution of ensembles of galaxies from z = 3 to the present day. In this paper, we focus on the brightest optical emission-line ratios, [N II]/Halpha and [O III]/Hbeta. We use the optical diagnostic Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram as a tool for investigating the spectral properties of ensembles of active galaxies. We use four redshift windows chosen to exploit new near-infrared multi-object spectrographs. We predict how the BPT diagram will appear in these four redshift windows given different sets of assumptions. We show that the position of star-forming galaxies on the BPT diagram traces the interstellar medium conditions and radiation field in galaxies at a given redshift. Galaxies containing active galactic nucleus (AGN) form a mixing sequence with purely star-forming galaxies. This mixing sequence may change dramatically with cosmic time, due to the metallicity sensitivity of the optical emission-lines. Furthermore, the position of the mixing sequence may probe metallicity gradients in galaxies as a function of redshift, depending on the size of the AGN narrow-line region. We apply our latest slow shock models for gas shocked by galactic-scale winds. We show that at high redshift, galactic wind shocks are clearly separated from AGN in line ratio space. Instead, shocks from galactic winds mimic high metallicity starburst galaxies. We discuss our models in the context of future large near-infrared spectroscopic surveys.

AB  - We compare a large sample of galaxies between 0.5 < z < 2.6 with theoretical predictions for how the optical diagnostic line ratios in galaxy ensembles change as a function of cosmic time. We show that star-forming galaxies at high redshift (z > 1.5) are consistent with a model in which the interstellar medium conditions are more extreme at high redshift than seen in the global spectra of local galaxies. We speculate that global spectra of our high-redshift galaxies may be dominated by H II regions similar to the extreme clumpy, dense star-forming complexes in the Antennae and M82. The transition to local-type conditions occurs between 0.8 < z < 1.5. We conclude that classification schemes developed for local samples should not be applied at high redshift (z >= 1.5). We use our theoretical models to derive a new redshift-dependent classification line that utilizes the standard optical diagnostic line ratios [O III]/Hbeta and [N II]/Halpha. Our new line can be used to separate star-forming galaxies from active galactic nuclei (AGN) between z = 0 to z ~ 3.5. We anticipate that our redshift-dependent optical classification line will be useful for future large surveys with near-infrared multi-object spectrographs. We apply our classification line to a sample of gravitationally lensed galaxies at z ~ 2.5. Although limited by small numbers, we show that our classification line is consistent with the position of AGN that have been independently confirmed via other methods.

AB  - We report the results of a full-Stokes survey of all four 18 cm OH lines in 77 OH megamasers (OHMs) using the Arecibo Observatory. This is the first survey of OHMs that included observations of the OH satellite lines; only four of the 77 OHMs have existing satellite line observations in the literature. Satellite line emission is detected in five sources, three of which are redetections of previously published sources. The two sources with new detections of satellite line emission are IRAS F10173+0829, which was detected at 1720 MHz, and IRAS F15107+0724, for which both the 1612 MHz and 1720 MHz lines were detected. In IRAS F15107+0724, the satellite lines are partially conjugate, as 1720 MHz absorption and 1612 MHz emission have the same structure at some velocities within the source, along with additional broader 1612 MHz emission. This is the first observed example of conjugate satellite lines in an OHM. In the remaining sources, no satellite line emission is observed. The detections and upper limits are generally consistent with models of OHM emission in which all of the 18 cm OH lines have the same excitation temperature. There is no evidence for a significant population of strong satellite line emitters among OHMs.

AB  - We investigate whether the Hubble sequence can be reproduced by the relics of merger events. We verify that, at zmedian = 0.65, the abundant population of anomalous starbursts - i.e. with peculiar morphologies and abnormal kinematics - is mainly linked to the local spirals. Their morphologies are dominated by young stars and are intimately related to their ionised-gas kinematics. We show that both morphologies and kinematics can be reproduced by using gas modelling from Barnes' (2002, MNRAS, 333, 481) study of major mergers. Their gas content may be indirectly evaluated by assuming that distant starbursts follow the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation: the median gas fraction is found to be 31%. Using our modelling to estimate the gas-to-star transformation during a merger, we identify the gas fraction in the progenitors to be generally above 50%. All distant and massive starbursts can be distributed along a temporal sequence from the first passage to the nuclei fusion and then to the disk rebuilding phase. This later phase has been recently illustrated for J033245.11-274724.0, a distant compact galaxy dominated by a red, dust-enshrouded disk. This active production of rebuilt disks is in excellent agreement with model predictions for gaseous rich encounters. It confirms that the rebuilding spiral disk scenario - a strong and recent reprocessing of most disks by major mergers - is possibly an important channel for the formation of present-day disks in grand-design spirals. Because half of the present-day spirals had peculiar morphologies and anomalous kinematics at zmedian = 0.65, they could indeed have been in major merger phases 6 Gyr ago, and almost all at z ~ 1. It is time now to study in detail the formation of spiral disks and of their substructures, including bulge, disks, arms, bars and rings that may mainly originate from instabilities created during the last major merger. Many galaxies also show a helicoidal structure, which is probably due to a central torque, and seems to play an important role in regulating the angular momentum of the newly-formed disks.

AB  - We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance Lambda cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.

AB  - We take advantage of the largest high-resolution simulation of cosmic structure growth ever carried out - the Millennium Simulation of the concordance Lambda cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogony - to study how the star formation histories, ages and metallicities of elliptical galaxies depend on environment and on stellar mass. We concentrate on a galaxy formation model which is tuned to fit the joint luminosity/colour/morphology distribution of low-redshift galaxies. Massive ellipticals in this model have higher metal abundances, older luminosity-weighted ages and shorter star formation time-scales, but lower assembly redshifts, than less massive systems. Within clusters the typical masses, ages and metal abundances of ellipticals are predicted to decrease, on average, with increasing distance from the cluster centre. We also quantify the effective number of progenitors of ellipticals as a function of present stellar mass, finding typical numbers below two for M* < 1011Msolar, rising to approximately five for the most massive systems. These findings are consistent with recent observational results that suggest `down-sizing' or `antihierarchical' behaviour for the star formation history of the elliptical galaxy population, despite the fact that our model includes all the standard elements of hierarchical galaxy formation and is implemented on the standard, LambdaCDM cosmogony.

AB  - We present high- and intermediate resolution radio observations of the central region in the spiral galaxy IC 2497, performed using the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 18 cm, and the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) at 18 cm and 6 cm. We detect two compact radio sources, with brightness temperatures above 105 K, suggesting that they are related to AGN activity. We show that the total 18 cm radio emission from the galaxy is dominated neither by these compact sources nor large-scale emission, but extended emission confined within a sub-kpc central region. IC 2497 therefore appears as a typical luminous infrared galaxy that exhibits a nuclear starburst with a massive star formation rate (M > 5 M&sun;) of 12.4 M&sun;/yr. These results are in line with the hypothesis that the ionisation nebula ``Hanny's Voorwerp'' at a distance of ~ 15-25 kpc from the galaxy is ionised by the radiation cone of the AGN.

AB  - We report the discovery and confirmation of a transiting circumbinary planet (PH1b) around KIC 4862625, an eclipsing binary in the Kepler field. The planet was discovered by volunteers searching the first six Quarters of publicly available Kepler data as part of the Planet Hunters citizen science project. Transits of the planet across the larger and brighter of the eclipsing stars are detectable by visual inspection every ~137 days, with seven transits identified in Quarters 1-11. The physical and orbital parameters of both the host stars and planet were obtained via a photometric-dynamical model, simultaneously fitting both the measured radial velocities and the Kepler light curve of KIC 4862625. The 6.18 $\pm$ 0.17 R ⊕ planet orbits outside the 20 day orbit of an eclipsing binary consisting of an F dwarf (1.734 $\pm$ 0.044 R &sun;, 1.528 $\pm$ 0.087 M &sun;) and M dwarf (0.378 $\pm$ 0.023 R &sun;, 0.408 $\pm$ 0.024 M &sun;). For the planet, we find an upper mass limit of 169 M ⊕ (0.531 Jupiter masses) at the 99.7% confidence level. With a radius and mass less than that of Jupiter, PH1b is well within the planetary regime. Outside the planet's orbit, at ~1000 AU, a previously unknown visual binary has been identified that is likely bound to the planetary system, making this the first known case of a quadruple star system with a transiting planet.

AB  - We study the spectral properties of intermediate mass galaxies (M* ˜ 1010.7 M&sun;) as a function of colour and morphology. We use Galaxy Zoo to define three morphological classes of galaxies, namely early types (ellipticals), late-type (disc-dominated) face-on spirals and early-type (bulge-dominated) face-on spirals. We classify these galaxies as blue or red according to their Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) g - r colour and use the spectral fitting code Versatile Spectral Analyses to calculate time-resolved star formation histories, metallicity and total starlight dust extinction from their SDSS fibre spectra.  We find that red late-type spirals show less star formation in the last 500 Myr than blue late-type spirals by up to a factor of 3, but share similar star formation histories at earlier times. This decline in recent star formation explains their redder colour: their chemical and dust content are the same. We postulate that red late-type spirals are recent descendants of blue late-type spirals, with their star formation curtailed in the last 500 Myr. The red late-type spirals are however still forming stars ~=17 times faster than red ellipticals over the same period.  Red early-type spirals lie between red late-type spirals and red ellipticals in terms of recent-to-intermediate star formation and dust content. Therefore, it is plausible that these galaxies represent an evolutionary link between these two populations. They are more likely to evolve directly into red ellipticals than red late-type spirals, which show star formation histories and dust content closer to blue late-type spirals.  Blue ellipticals show similar star formation histories as blue spirals (regardless of type), except that they have formed less stars in the last 100 Myr. However, blue ellipticals have different dust content, which peaks at lower extinction values than all spiral galaxies. Therefore, many blue ellipticals are unlikely to be descendants of blue spirals, suggesting there may not be single evolutionary path for this group of galaxies.

AB  - We present the second of two papers concerning the origin and evolution of local early-type galaxies exhibiting dust features. We use optical and radio data to examine the nature of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in these objects, and compare these with a carefully constructed control sample.  We find that dust lane early-type galaxies are much more likely to host emission-line AGN than the control sample galaxies. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between radio and emission-line AGN activity in dust lane early types, but not the control sample. Dust lane early-type galaxies show the same distribution of AGN properties in rich and poor environments, suggesting a similar triggering mechanism. By contrast, this is not the case for early types with no dust features. These findings strongly suggest that dust lane early-type galaxies are starburst systems formed in gas-rich mergers. Further evidence in support of this scenario is provided by enhanced star formation and black hole accretion rates in these objects. Dust lane early types therefore represent an evolutionary stage between starbursting and quiescent galaxies. In these objects, the AGN has already been triggered but has not as yet completely destroyed the gas reservoir required for star formation. This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 250 000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo 2 project. Their contributions are individually acknowledged at .

AB  - Analysis of galaxies with overlapping images offers a direct way to probe the distribution of dust extinction and its effects on the background light. We present a catalog of 1990 such galaxy pairs selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) by volunteers of the Galaxy Zoo project. We highlight subsamples which are particularly useful for retrieving such properties of the dust distribution as UV extinction, the extent perpendicular to the disk plane, and extinction in the inner parts of disks. The sample spans wide ranges of morphology and surface brightness, opening up the possibility of using this technique to address systematic changes in dust extinction or distribution with galaxy type. This sample will form the basis for forthcoming work on the ranges of dust distributions in local disk galaxies, both for their astrophysical implications and as the low-redshift part of a study of the evolution of dust properties. Separate lists and figures show deep overlaps, where the inner regions of the foreground galaxy are backlit, and the relatively small number of previously-known overlapping pairs outside the SDSS DR7 sky coverage.

AB  - We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N_eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data. [Abridged]

AB  - We investigate the star formation rates of quiescent galaxies at high redshift (0.3 < z < 2.5) using 3D-HST WFC3 grism spectroscopy and Spitzer mid-infrared data. We select quiescent galaxies on the basis of the widely used UVJ color-color criteria. Spectral energy distribution fitting (rest frame optical and near-IR) indicates very low star formation rates for quiescent galaxies (sSFR ~ 10^-12 yr^-1). However, SED fitting can miss star formation if it is hidden behind high dust obscuration and ionizing radiation is re-emitted in the mid-infrared. It is therefore fundamental to measure the dust-obscured SFRs with a mid-IR indicator. We stack the MIPS-24um images of quiescent objects in five redshift bins centered on z = 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.7, 2.2 and perform aperture photometry. Including direct 24um detections, we find sSFR ~ 10^-11.9 * (1+z)^4 yr^-1. These values are higher than those indicated by SED fitting, but at each redshift they are 20-40 times lower than those of typical star forming galaxies. The true SFRs of quiescent galaxies might be even lower, as we show that the mid-IR fluxes can be due to processes unrelated to ongoing star formation, such as cirrus dust heated by old stellar populations and circumstellar dust. Our measurements show that star formation quenching is very efficient at every redshift. The measured SFR values are at z > 1.5 marginally consistent with the ones expected from gas recycling (assuming that mass loss from evolved stars refuels star formation) and well above that at lower redshifts.

AB  - We report the first analytical expression purely constructed by a machine to determine photometric redshifts ($z_\rm phot$) of galaxies. A simple and reliable functional form is derived using $41,214$ galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 (SDSS-DR10) spectroscopic sample. The method automatically dropped the $u$ and $z$ bands, relying only on $g$, $r$ and $i$ for the final solution. Applying this expression to other $1,417,181$ SDSS-DR10 galaxies, with measured spectroscopic redshifts ($z_\rm spec$), we achieved a mean $\langle (z_\rm phot - z_\rm spec)/(1+z_\rm spec)\rangle\lesssim 0.0086$ and a scatter $\sigma_(z_\rm phot - z_\rm spec)/(1+z_\rm spec)\lesssim 0.045$ when averaged up to $z \lesssim 1.0$. This work is the first use of symbolic regression in cosmology, representing a leap forward in astronomy-data-mining connection.

AB  - We present five new outbursting AM CVn systems and one candidate discovered as part of an ongoing search for such systems using the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). This is the first large-area, systematic search for AM CVn systems using only large-amplitude photometric variability to select candidates. Three of the confirmed systems and the candidate system were discovered as part of the PTF transient search. Two systems were found as part of a search for outbursts through the PTF photometric data base. We discuss the observed characteristics of each of these systems, including the orbital periods of two systems. We also consider the position of these systems, selected in a colour-independent survey, in colour-colour space and compare to systems selected solely by their colours. We find that the colours of our newly discovered systems do not differ significantly from those of previously known systems, but significant errors preclude a definitive answer.

The two candidates presented here survive checks for false positives, including examination of the pixel offset to constrain the possibility of a background eclipsing binary. The orbital periods of the planet candidates are 97.46 days (KIC 4552729) and 284.03 (KIC 10005758) days and the modeled planet radii are 5.3 and 3.8 R ⊕. The latter star has an additional known planet candidate with a radius of 5.05 R ⊕ and a period of 134.49 days, which was detected by the Kepler pipeline. The discovery of these candidates illustrates the value of massively distributed volunteer review of the Kepler database to recover candidates which were otherwise uncataloged.  .

AB  - PTF10ops is a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), whose light curve and spectral properties place it outside the current SN Ia subtype classifications. Its spectra display the characteristic lines of subluminous SNe Ia, but it has a normal-width light curve with a long rise time, typical of normal-luminosity SNe Ia. The early-time optical spectra of PTF10ops were modelled using a spectral fitting code and found to have all the lines typically seen in subluminous SNe Ia, without the need to invoke more uncommon elements. The host galaxy environment of PTF10ops is also unusual with no galaxy detected at the position of the SN down to an absolute limiting magnitude of r>=-12.0 mag, but a very massive galaxy is present at a separation of ˜148 kpc and at the same redshift as suggested by the SN spectral features. The progenitor of PTF10ops is most likely a very old star, possibly in a low-metallicity environment, which affects its explosion mechanism and observational characteristics. PTF10ops does not easily fit into any of the current models of either subluminous or normal SN Ia progenitor channels.

AB  - We present an analysis of the maximum light, near-ultraviolet (NUV; 2900 < lambda < 5500 Å) spectra of 32 low-redshift (0.001 < z < 0.08) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. We combine this spectroscopic sample with high-quality gri light curves obtained with robotic telescopes to measure SN Ia photometric parameters, such as stretch (light-curve width), optical colour and brightness (Hubble residual). By comparing our new data to a comparable sample of SNe Ia at intermediate redshift (0.4 < z < 0.9), we detect modest spectral evolution (3sigma), in the sense that our mean low-redshift NUV spectrum has a depressed flux compared to its intermediate-redshift counterpart. We also see a strongly increased dispersion about the mean with decreasing wavelength, confirming the results of earlier surveys. We show that these trends are consistent with changes in metallicity as predicted by contemporary SN Ia spectral models. We also examine the properties of various NUV spectral diagnostics in the individual SN spectra. We find a general correlation between SN stretch and the velocity (or position) of many NUV spectral features. In particular, we observe that higher stretch SNe have larger Ca II H&K velocities, which also correlate with host galaxy stellar mass. This latter trend is probably driven by the well-established correlation between stretch and host galaxy stellar mass. We find no significant trends between UV spectral features and optical colour. Mean spectra constructed according to whether the SN has a positive or negative Hubble residual show very little difference at NUV wavelengths, indicating that the NUV evolution and variation we identify does not directly correlate with Hubble diagram residuals. Our work confirms and strengthens earlier conclusions regarding the complex behaviour of SNe Ia in the NUV spectral region, but suggests the correlations we find are more useful in constraining progenitor models rather than improving the use of SNe Ia as cosmological probes.

AB  - The Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) provides high cadence and high resolution images of the structure and morphology of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the inner heliosphere. CME directions and propagation speeds have often been estimated through the use of time-elongation maps obtained from the STEREO Heliospheric Imager (HI) data. Many of these CMEs have been identified by citizen scientists working within the SolarStormWatch project (<ExternalRef> <RefSource> www.solarstormwatch.com </RefSource> <RefTarget Address="http://www.solarstormwatch.com" TargetType="URL"/> </ExternalRef>) as they work towards providing robust real-time identification of Earth-directed CMEs. The wide field of view of HI allows scientists to directly observe the two-dimensional (2D) structures, while the relative simplicity of time-elongation analysis means that it can be easily applied to many such events, thereby enabling a much deeper understanding of how CMEs evolve between the Sun and the Earth. For events with certain orientations, both the rear and front edges of the CME can be monitored at varying heliocentric distances ( R) between the Sun and 1 AU. Here we take four example events with measurable position angle widths and identified by the citizen scientists. These events were chosen for the clarity of their structure within the HI cameras and their long track lengths in the time-elongation maps. We show a linear dependency with R for the growth of the radial width ( W) and the 2D aspect ratio ( chi) of these CMEs, which are measured out to ≈ 0.7 AU. We estimated the radial width from a linear best fit for the average of the four CMEs. We obtained the relationships W=0.14 R+0.04 for the width and chi=2.5 R+0.86 for the aspect ratio ( W and R in units of AU).

AB  - We present the discovery of a long-term stable L5 (trailing) Neptune Trojan in data acquired to search for candidate trans-Neptunian objects for the New Horizons spacecraft to fly by during an extended post-Pluto mission. This Neptune Trojan, 2011 HM102, has the highest inclination (29.$\,^\circ$4) of any known member of this population. It is intrinsically brighter than any single L5 Jupiter Trojan at HV ~ 8.18. We have determined its gri colors (a first for any L5 Neptune Trojan), which we find to be similar to the moderately red colors of the L4 Neptune Trojans, suggesting similar surface properties for members of both Trojan clouds. We also present colors derived from archival data for two L4 Neptune Trojans (2006 RJ103 and 2007 VL305), better refining the overall color distribution of the population. In this document we describe the discovery circumstances, our physical characterization of 2011 HM102, and this object's implications for the Neptune Trojan population overall. Finally, we discuss the prospects for detecting 2011 HM102 from the New Horizons spacecraft during its close approach in mid- to late-2013.

AB  - We present the first collective evidence that Fermi-detected jets of high kinetic power (L kin) are dominated by inverse Compton emission from upscattered external photons. Using a sample with a broad range in orientation angle, including radio galaxies and blazars, we find that very high power sources (L kin > 1045.5 erg s-1) show a significant increase in the ratio of inverse Compton to synchrotron power (Compton dominance) with decreasing orientation angle, as measured by the radio core dominance and confirmed by the distribution of superluminal speeds. This increase is consistent with beaming expectations for external Compton (EC) emission, but not for synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission. For the lowest power jets (L kin < 1043.5 erg s-1), no trend between Compton and radio core dominance is found, consistent with SSC. Importantly, the EC trend is not seen for moderately high power flat spectrum radio quasars with strong external photon fields. Coupled with the evidence that jet power is linked to the jet speed, this finding suggests that external photon fields become the dominant source of seed photons in the jet comoving frame only for the faster and therefore more powerful jets.

AB  - We present evidence from a sample of 544 galaxies from the DEEP2 Survey for evolution of the internal kinematics of blue galaxies with stellar masses ranging 8.0 < log M *(M &sun;) < 10.7 over 0.2 < z < 1.2. DEEP2 provides galaxy spectra and Hubble imaging from which we measure emission-line kinematics and galaxy inclinations, respectively. Our large sample allows us to overcome scatter intrinsic to galaxy properties in order to examine trends in kinematics. We find that at a fixed stellar mass, galaxies systematically decrease in disordered motions and increase in rotation velocity and potential well depth with time. Massive galaxies are the most well ordered at all times examined, with higher rotation velocities and less disordered motions than less massive galaxies. We quantify disordered motions with an integrated gas velocity dispersion corrected for beam smearing (sigma g ). It is unlike the typical pressure-supported velocity dispersion measured for early type galaxies and galaxy bulges. Because both seeing and the width of our spectral slits comprise a significant fraction of the galaxy sizes, sigma g  integrates over velocity gradients on large scales which can correspond to non-ordered gas kinematics. We compile measurements of galaxy kinematics from the literature over 1.2 < z < 3.8 and do not find any trends with redshift, likely for the most part, because these data sets are biased toward the most highly star-forming systems. In summary, over the last ~8 billion years since z = 1.2, blue galaxies evolve from disordered to ordered systems as they settle to become the rotation-dominated disk galaxies observed in the universe today, with the most massive galaxies being the most evolved at any time.

AB  - Aims.We constrain the evolution of the galaxy mass and luminosity functions from the analysis of (public) multi-wavelength data in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) area, obtained from GOODS and other projects, including very deep high-resolution imaging by HST/ACS.Methods.Our reference catalogue of faint high-redshift galaxies, which we have thoroughly tested for completeness and reliability, comes from a deep (S3.6>= 1  muJy) image by IRAC on the Spitzer Observatory. These imaging data in the field are complemented by extensive optical spectroscopy by the ESO VLT/FORS2 and VIMOS spectrographs, while deep K-band VLT/ISAAC imaging is also used to derive further complementary statistical constraints and to assist the source identification and Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) analysis. We selected a highly reliable IRAC 3.6 mum sub-sample of 1478 galaxies with S3.6>= 10  muJy, 47% of which have spectroscopic redshift, while for the remaining objects we used both COMBO-17 data (Wolf et al. 2004, A&A, 421, 913) and the code Hyperz (Bolzonella et al. 2000, A&A, 363, 476) to estimate the photometric redshift. This very extensive dataset was exploited to assess evolutionary effects in the galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions, while luminosity/density evolution is further constrained with the number counts and redshift distributions. The deep ACS imaging allows us to differentiate between these evolutionary paths by morphological type, which our simulations show to be reliable at least up to z˜ 1.5 for the two main early- (E/S0) and late-type (Sp/Irr) classes.Results.These data, as well as our direct estimate of the stellar mass function above M_ast h^2=1010  M_&sun; for the spheroidal subclass, consistently show a progressive dearth of such objects starting at z˜ 0.7, paralleled by an increase in luminosity. A similar trend, with a more modest decrease in the mass function, is also shared by spiral galaxies, while the irregulars/mergers show an increased incidence at higher z. Remarkably, this decrease in the comoving density with redshift of the total population appears to depend on galaxy mass, being stronger for moderate-mass galaxies, but almost absent until z=1.4 for high-mass galaxies, thus confirming previous evidence of a ``downsizing'' effect in galaxy formation.Conclusions.Our favoured interpretation of the evolutionary trends for the two galaxy categories is that of a progressive morphological transformation (due to gas exhaustion and, likely, merging) from the star-forming to the passively evolving phase, starting at z>= 2 and holding on down to z˜ 0.7. The rate of this process appears to depend on galaxy mass, being already largely settled by z˜ 1 for the most massive systems.

AB  - Using the Gaussian+Schechter composite luminosity functions measured from the ESO-Sculptor Survey (lapparent03aI, A&A, 404, 831) and assuming that these functions do not evolve with redshift out to z˜1, we obtain evidence for evolution in the late spectral class containing late-type Spiral (Sc+Sd) and dwarf Irregular (dI) galaxies. There are indications that the Sc+Sd galaxies are the evolving population, but we cannot exclude that the dI galaxies also undergo some evolution. This evolution is detected as an increase of the Sc+Sd+dI galaxy density which can be modeled as either n(z)∝1+3(z-0.15) or n(z)∝(1+z)2 using the currently favored cosmological parameters Omegam=0.3 and OmegaLambda=0.7; the uncertainty in the linear and power-law evolution rates is of the order of unity. For Omegam=1.0 and OmegaLambda=0.0, the linear and power-law evolution rates are ˜4$\pm$1 and ˜2.5$\pm$1 respectively. Both models yield a good match to the ESS BVRc redshift distributions to 21-22mag and to the number-counts to 23-23.5mag, which probe the galaxy distribution to redshifts z˜0.5 and z˜1.0 respectively.  The present analysis shows the usefulness of the joint use of the magnitude and redshift distributions for studying galaxy evolution. It also illustrates how Gaussian+Schechter composite luminosity functions provide more robust constraints on the evolution rate than pure Schechter luminosity functions, thus emphasizing the importance of performing realistic parameterizations of the luminosity functions for studying galaxy evolution.  The detected density evolution indicates that mergers could play a significant role in the evolution of late-type Spiral and dwarf Irregular galaxies. However, the ESO-Sculptor density increase with redshift could also be caused by a ˜1mag brightening of the Sc+Sd+dI galaxies at z˜0.5 and a ˜ 1.5-2.0mag brightening at z˜1, which is compatible with the expected passive brightening of Sc galaxies at these redshifts. Distinguishing between luminosity and density evolution is a major difficulty as these produce the same effect on the redshift and magnitude distributions. The detected evolution rate of the ESO-Sculptor Sc+Sd+dI galaxies is nevertheless within the range of measured values from the other existing analyses, whether they provide evidence for density or luminosity evolution.

AB  - The evolution of rest-frame B-band luminosities, stellar masses, and number densities of field galaxies in the Hubble Deep Fields North and South are studied as a function of rest-frame B-band morphological type out to redshift z~3 using a sample of 1231 I<27 galaxies with spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. We find that the comoving and relative number densities of ellipticals and spirals decline rapidly at z>1, although examples of both types exist at z>2. The number and number fraction of peculiar galaxies consistent with undergoing major mergers rise dramatically and consistently at redshifts z>2. Through simulations we argue that this change is robust at the 4 sigma level against morphological K-corrections and redshift effects. We also trace the evolution of rest-frame B-band luminosity density as a function of morphology out to z~3, finding that the luminosity density is steadily dominated by peculiars at z>1.5 with a peak fraction of 60%-90% at z~3. By z~0.5, B-band luminosity fractions are similar to their local values. At z~1 the B-band luminosity densities of ellipticals and spirals are similar, with a combined contribution of ~90% of the total luminosity at z<1. The stellar mass density follows a trend similar to that of the luminosity density, with some important exceptions. At high redshifts, z>2, 60%-80% of stellar mass appears attached to peculiars, while at z<1, 80%-95% of stellar mass is attached to ellipticals and spirals. The total integrated stellar mass density of peculiars slightly declines at lower redshift, suggesting that these systems evolve into normal galaxies. In contrast to the luminosity density, the stellar mass density of ellipticals is greater than spirals at z<1, and the stellar masses of both types grow together at z<1, while number densities remain constant. From a structural analysis of these galaxies we conclude that galaxy formation at z>2 is dominated by major merging, while at z<1 the dominate modes are either minor mergers or quiescent star formation produced by gas infall. Finally, at z~1.5 the comoving luminosity, mass, and number densities of spirals, ellipticals, and peculiars are nearly equal, suggesting that this is the ``equilibrium'' point in galaxy evolution and an important phase transition in the universe's history.

AB  - We test whether the spiral patterns apparent in many large disk galaxies should be thought of as dynamical features that are stationary in a corotating frame for >~ t dyn, as implied by the density wave approach for explaining spiral arms. If such spiral arms have enhanced star formation (SF), observational tracers for different stages of the SF sequence should show a spatial ordering, from upstream to downstream in the corotating frame: dense H I, CO, tracing molecular hydrogen gas, 24 mum emission tracing enshrouded SF, and UV emission tracing unobscured young stars. We argue that such a spatial ordering should be reflected in the angular cross-correlation (CC, in polar coordinates) using all azimuthal positions among pairs of these tracers; the peak of the CC should be offset from zero, in different directions inside and outside the corotation radius. Recent spiral SF simulations by Dobbs & Pringle show explicitly that for the case of a stationary spiral arm potential such angular offsets between gas and young stars of differing ages should be observable as cross-correlation offsets. We calculate the angular cross-correlations for different observational SF sequence tracers in 12 nearby spiral galaxies, drawing on a data set with high-quality maps of the neutral gas (H I, THINGS) and molecular gas (CO, HERACLES), along with 24 mum emission (Spitzer, SINGS); we include FUV images (GALEX) and 3.6 mum emission (Spitzer, IRAC) for some galaxies, tracing aging stars and longer timescales. In none of the resulting tracer cross-correlations for this sample do we find systematic angular offsets, which would be expected for a stationary dynamical spiral pattern of well-defined pattern speed. This result indicates that spiral density waves in their simplest form are not an important aspect of explaining spirals in large disk galaxies.

AB  - We built a family of non-axisymmetric potential models for normal non-barred or weakly barred spiral galaxies as defined in the simplest classification of galaxies: the Hubble sequence. For this purpose, a three-dimensional self-gravitating model for the spiral arm PERLAS is superimposed on the galactic axisymmetric potentials. We analyze the stellar dynamics varying only the pitch angle of the spiral arms, from 4$\,^\circ$ to 40$\,^\circ$ for an Sa galaxy, from 8$\,^\circ$ to 45$\,^\circ$ for an Sb galaxy, and from 10$\,^\circ$ to 60$\,^\circ$ for an Sc galaxy. Self-consistency is indirectly tested through periodic orbital analysis and through density response studies for each morphological type. Based on ordered behavior, periodic orbit studies show that, for pitch angles up to approximately 15$\,^\circ$, 18$\,^\circ$, and 20$\,^\circ$ for Sa, Sb, and Sc galaxies, respectively, the density response supports the spiral arms' potential, a requisite for the existence of a long-lasting large-scale spiral structure. Beyond those limits, the density response tends to ``avoid'' the potential imposed by maintaining lower pitch angles in the density response; in that case, the spiral arms may be explained as transient features rather than long-lasting large-scale structures. In a second limit, from a phase-space orbital study based on chaotic behavior, we found that for pitch angles larger than ~30$\,^\circ$, ~40$\,^\circ$, and ~50$\,^\circ$ for Sa, Sb, and Sc galaxies, respectively, chaotic orbits dominate the all phase-space prograde region that surrounds the periodic orbits sculpting the spiral arms and even destroying them. This result seems to be in good agreement with observations of pitch angles in typical isolated normal spiral galaxies.

AB  - High-resolution N-body simulations using different codes and initial condition techniques reveal two different behaviours for the rotation frequency of transient spiral arms like structures. Whereas unbarred discs present spiral arms nearly corotating with disc particles, strong barred models (bulged or bulgeless) quickly develop a bar-spiral structure dominant in density, with a pattern speed almost constant in radius. As the bar strength decreases the arm departs from bar rigid rotation and behaves similar to the unbarred case. In strong barred models, we detect in the frequency space other subdominant and slower modes at large radii, in agreement with previous studies, however, we also detect them in the configuration space. We propose that the distinctive behaviour of the dominant spiral modes can be exploited in order to constraint the nature of Galactic spiral arms by the astrometric survey Gaia and by 2D spectroscopic surveys like Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area Survey (CALIFA) and Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MANGA) in external galaxies.

AB  - Studying star formation in spiral arms tells us not only about the evolution of star formation, and molecular clouds, but can also tell us about the nature of spiral structure in galaxies. I will address both these topics using the results of recent simulations and observations. Galactic scale simulations are beginning to examine in detail the evolution of GMCs as they form in spiral arms, and then disperse by stellar feedback or shear. The overall timescale for this process appears comparable to the crossing time of the GMCs, a few Myrs for $10^5$ M$_\odot$ clouds, 20 Myr or so for more massive GMCs. Both simulations and observations show that the massive clouds are found in the spiral arms, likely as a result of cloud-cloud collisions. Simulations including stars should also tell us about the stellar age distribution in GMCs, and across spiral arms. More generally, recent work on spiral galaxies suggests that the dynamics of gas flows in spiral arms are different in longlived and transient spiral arms, resulting in different age patterns in the stars. Such results could be used to help establish the main driver of spiral structure in the Milky Way (Toomre instabilities, the bar, or nearby companion galaxies) in conjunction with future surveys.

AB  - Galaxies with the mass of the Milky Way dominate the stellar mass density of the universe but it is uncertain how and when they were assembled. Here we study progenitors of these galaxies out to z = 2.5, using data from the 3D-HST and CANDELS Treasury surveys. We find that galaxies with present-day stellar masses of log (M) ≈ 10.7 built ~90% of their stellar mass since z = 2.5, with most of the star formation occurring before z = 1. In marked contrast to the assembly history of massive elliptical galaxies, mass growth is not limited to large radii: the mass in the central 2 kpc of the galaxies increased by a factor of 3.2^+0.8_-0.7 between z = 2.5 and z = 1. We therefore rule out simple models in which bulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed around them. Instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks, through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. We find that after z = 1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continued to be built up, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z ~ 1 galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.

AB  - Spiral galaxies are observed to exhibit a range of morphologies, in particular in the shape of spiral arms. A key diagnostic parameter is the pitch angle, which describes how tightly wound the spiral arms are. Observationally and analytically, a correlation between pitch angle and galactic shear rate has been detected. For the first time, we examine whether this effect is detected in N-body simulations by calculating and comparing pitch angles of both individual density waves and overall spiral structure in a suite of N-body simulations. We find that higher galactic shear rates produce more tightly wound spiral arms, both in individual mode patterns (density waves) and in the overall density enhancement. Although the mode pattern pitch angles by construction remain constant with time, the overall logarithmic spiral arm winds over time, which could help to explain the scatter in the relation between pitch angle versus shear seen from observations. The correlation between spiral arm pitch angle and galactic shear rate that we find in N-body simulations may also explain why late Hubble type of spiral galaxies tend to have more open arms.

AB  - We seek to understand the origin of radial migration in spiral galaxies by analysing in detail the structure and evolution of an idealized, isolated galactic disc. To understand the redistribution of stars, we characterize the time evolution of properties of spirals that spontaneously form in the disc. Our models unambiguously show that in such discs, single spirals are unlikely, but that a number of transient patterns may coexist in the disc. However, we also show that while spirals are transient in amplitude, at any given time the disc favours patterns of certain pattern speeds. Using several runs with different numerical parameters we show that the properties of spirals that occur spontaneously in the disc do not sensitively depend on resolution. The existence of multiple transient patterns has large implications for the orbits of stars in the disc, and we therefore examine the resonant scattering mechanisms that profoundly alter angular momenta of individual stars. We confirm that the corotation scattering mechanism described by Sellwood & Binney is responsible for the largest angular momentum changes in our simulations.

AB  - Context. The connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies has been widely studied and found to be of great importance for providing answers to some fundamental questions related to AGN fuelling mechanisms, and both their formation and evolution.  Aims: Using X-ray data and one of the deepest broad-band optical data sets available, we study how morphology and colours are related to X-ray properties for sources at redshifts z <= 2.0, using a sample of 262 AGN in the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS).  Methods: We performed our morphological classification using the galSVM code, which is a new method that is particularly suited to dealing with high-redshift sources. Colour-magnitude diagrams were studied in relationship to redshift, morphology, X-ray obscuration, and X-ray-to-optical flux ratio. We analysed the different regions in the colour-magnitude diagrams, and searched for correlations with the observed properties of AGN populations using models of their formation and evolution.  Results: We confirm that a robust and reliable morphological classification of a general galaxy population at high redshift should be based on a multi-parametric approach. At least 50% of X-ray detected AGN at z <= 2.0 analysed in this work reside in spheroidal and bulge-dominated galaxies, while at least 18% have disk-dominated hosts. This suggests that different mechanisms may be responsible for triggering the nuclear activity. When analysing populations of X-ray detected AGN in both colour-magnitude and colour-stellar mass diagrams, the highest number of sources is found to reside in the green valley at redshifts ≈0.5-1.5. However, a larger number of low-luminosity AGN have been detected than in previous works owing to the substantial depth of the SXDS optical data. Whether AGN are hosted by early- or late-type galaxies, no clear relationship has been found with the optical colours (independently of redshift), as is typical of normal galaxies. Both early- and late-type AGN cover similar ranges of X-ray obscuration, for both unobscured and obscured sources.  Conclusions: Our findings appear to confirm some previous suggestions that X-ray selected AGN residing in the green valley represent a transitional population, quenching star formation by means of different AGN feedback mechanisms and evolving to red-sequence galaxies. They might be hosted by similar sources (the majority of sources being late-type elliptical and lenticular galaxies, and early-type spirals) with similar stellar populations, which are triggered mainly by major and/or minor mergers, and in some cases by means of secular mechanism, as shown in previous numerical simulations. In the aforementioned transition we observe different phases of AGN activity, with some AGN being in the ``QSO-mode'' detected as compact, blue, and unobscured in X-rays, and with others passing through different phases before and after the ``QSO-mode'', being obscured and unobscured in X-rays, respectively.

AB  - Spiral density wave theory attempts to describe the spiral pattern in spiral galaxies in terms of a long-lived wave structure with a constant pattern speed in order to avoid the winding dilemma. The pattern is consequently a rigidly rotating, long-lived feature. We run an N-body/SPH simulation of a Milky Way-sized barred disk, and find that the spiral arms are transient features whose pattern speeds decrease with radius, in such a way that the pattern speed is almost equal to the rotation curve of the galaxy. We trace particle motion around the spiral arms. We show that particles from behind and in front of the spiral arm are drawn towards and join the arm. Particles move along the arm in the radial direction and we find a clear trend that they migrate toward the outer (inner) radii on the trailing (leading) side of the arm. Our simulations demonstrate that tat all radii where there is a co-rotating spiral arm the particles continue to be accelerated (decelerated) by the spiral arm for long periods, which leads to strong migration.

AB  - We use the dynamics of a galaxy, set up initially at a constant proper distance from an observer, to derive and illustrate two counter-intuitive general relativistic results. Although the galaxy does gradually join the expansion of the universe (Hubble flow), it does not necessarily recede from us. In particular, in the currently favored cosmological model, which includes a cosmological constant, the galaxy recedes from the observer as it joins the Hubble flow, but in the previously favored cold dark matter model, the galaxy approaches, passes through the observer, and joins the Hubble flow on the opposite side of the sky. We show that this behavior is consistent with the general relativistic idea that space is expanding and is determined by the acceleration of the expansion of the universe-not a force or drag associated with the expansion itself. We also show that objects at a constant proper distance will have a nonzero redshift; receding galaxies can be blueshifted and approaching galaxies can be redshifted.

AB  - We use standard general relativity to illustrate and clarify several common misconceptions about the expansion of the universe. To show the abundance of these misconceptions we cite numerous misleading, or easily misinterpreted, statements in the literature. In the context of the new standard LambdaCDM cosmology we point out confusions regarding the particle horizon, the event horizon, the `observable universe' and the Hubble sphere (distance at which recession velocity=c). We show that we can observe galaxies that have, and always have had, recession velocities greater than the speed of light. We explain why this does not violate special relativity and we link these concepts to observational tests. Attempts to restrict recession velocities to less than the speed of light require a special relativistic interpretation of cosmological redshifts. We analyze apparent magnitudes of supernovae and observationally rule out the special relativistic Doppler interpretation of cosmological redshifts at a confidence level of 23 sigma.

AB  - While it remains the staple of virtually all cosmological teaching, the concept of expanding space in explaining the increasing separation of galaxies has recently come under fire as a dangerous idea whose application leads to the development of confusion and the establishment of misconceptions. In this paper we develop a notion of expanding space that is completely valid as a framework for the description of the evolution of the universe and whose application allows an intuitive understanding of the influence of universal expansion. We also demonstrate how arguments against the concept in general have failed thus far, as they imbue expanding space with physical properties not consistent with the expectations of general relativity.

AB  - A common belief about big-bang cosmology is that the cosmological redshift cannot be properly viewed as a Doppler shift (that is, as evidence for a recession velocity) but must be viewed in terms of the stretching of space. We argue that, contrary to this view, the most natural interpretation of the redshift is as a Doppler shift, or rather as the accumulation of many infinitesimal Doppler shifts. The stretching-of-space interpretation obscures a central idea of relativity, namely that it is always valid to choose a coordinate system that is locally Minkowskian. We show that an observed frequency shift in any spacetime can be interpreted either as a kinematic (Doppler) shift or a gravitational shift by imagining a suitable family of observers along the photon's path. In the context of the expanding universe, the kinematic interpretation corresponds to a family of comoving observers and hence is more natural.

AB  - We introduce a stable, well tested Python implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed by Goodman & Weare (2010). The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ˜N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra  effort.

AB  - The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has been in operation since 2000 April. This paper presents the tenth public data release (DR10) from its current incarnation, SDSS-III. This data release includes the first spectroscopic data from the Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), along with spectroscopic data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) taken through 2012 July. The APOGEE instrument is a near-infrared R~22,500 300-fiber spectrograph covering 1.514--1.696 microns. The APOGEE survey is studying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 red giant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the Milky Way. DR10 includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or more times, from APOGEE. Derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities, effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are also included.DR10 also roughly doubles the number of BOSS spectra over those included in the ninth data release. DR10 includes a total of 1,507,954 BOSS spectra, comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra; 182,009 quasar spectra; and 159,327 stellar spectra, selected over 6373.2 square degrees.

AB  - We present SEDs fits to a sample of GeV-TeV FSRQs and compare the jet properties between FSRQs and BL Lacs. We show that the SEDs can be fit with the leptonic model, and both the minimum and broken Lorentz factors of relativistic electrons are well constrained, with medians of 48 and 240, respectively. No statistical difference on the Doppler factors between the FSRQs and BL Lacs is found. Assuming that the jet power is carried by electron-proton pairs, the magnetic field, and radiation field, we calculate the powers of these components and the total jet power based on our fitting results, hence derive the radiation efficiency and magnetization parameter of the jets. It is found that the FSRQ jets are dominated by the Poynting flux and have a high radiation efficiency, whereas the BL Lac jets are dominated by particles and have a lower radiation efficiency than FSRQs. Interestingly, different from BL Lacs, jet powers of FSRQs are proportional to their central black hole masses, favoring the scenario that the FSRQ jets are powered by the BZ mechanism. The jet production rate per central BH mass of FSRQs seems to be universal among these sources, whereas it varies over five orders of magnitude for BL Lacs. These results likely suggest that the dominating jet production mechanisms may be different for FSRQs and BL Lacs; the BZ process for FSRQs, the BP and/or BZ processes for BL Lacs, depending on structures and accretion rates of accretion disks. Jet power is correlated with the cavity kinetic power for our blazar sample. The magnetic field energy in the jets may provide the cavity kinetic energy for FSRQs and the kinetic energy of cold protons in the jets may be crucial for cavity kinetic energy for BL Lacs.

AB  - The de Vaucouleurs Atlas of Galaxies is an ambitious project to fully document the de Vaucouleurs revised Hubble galaxy classification system with modern images of high quality. Although built within the framework of the older Hubble system, de Vaucouleurs' system represents a point of view that has served astronomy well. The main goals of the project are to: (1) review the de Vaucouleurs revised Hubble galaxy classification system and its advantages in context of modern knowledge; (2) illustrate with modern CCD images all de Vaucouleurs types and show what his notation means; (3) provide modern interpretations of the features defining de Vaucouleurs types; (4) describe extensions or revisions to the system; (5) cover other aspects of galaxy morphology that have come to the forefront since de Vaucouleurs published his ideas on morphology; (6) provide a reference atlas for studies of high redshift galaxies; and (7) provide a general review of galaxy classification and morphology, building on previous works. The de Vaucouleurs Atlas of Galaxies is intended to be a high quality reference work for both students and professionals. By exclusively using images from electronic detectors, it will be the first major galaxy atlas geared to illustrating classical revised Hubble types using today's standard imaging methods, as opposed to photographic plates. In addition to the atlas of images, the work will also highlight what has been learned about the features defining galaxy morphology since the 1960s. The Atlas will be published by Cambridge University Press.

AB  - This two-volume atlas has been made to accompany and supplement A Revised Shapley-Ames Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (Carnegie Institution of Washington Publ., No. 635, 1981, 1987). It also extends, refines, and more completely illustrates the galaxy classification system set out in The Hubble Atlas of Galaxies (Publ., No. 618, 1961). The atlas proper consists of 340 panels illustrating 1168 individual galaxies. The galaxies are arranged in the order of the present classification sequence, starting with diskless E galaxies and ending with the Sm and Im late-type dwarfs and the amorphous types. Most of the 1246 galaxies of the original Shapley-Ames Catalog (1932) are illustrated. However, adequate plates have not been obtained for about 6% of the Shapley-Ames entries and are not included, but no gaps in the illustrated classification sequence result from this incompleteness. A few galaxies not in the Shapley-Ames Catalog, mostly Im dwarfs, are included to complete the description for parts of the dwarf classification scheme.

AB  - The Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies (CSRG) is a comprehensive compilation of diameters, axis ratios, relative bar position angles, and morphologies of inner and outer rings, pseudorings, and lenses in 3692 galaxies south of declination -17 deg. The purpose of the catalog is to evaluate the idea that these ring phenomena are related to orbital resonances with a bar or oval in galaxy potentials. The catalog is based on visual inspection of most of the 606 fields of the Science Research Council (SRC) IIIa-J southern sky survey, with the ESO-B, ESO-R, and Palomar Sky surveys used as auxiliaries when needed for overexposed core regions. The catalog is most complete for SRC fields 1-303 (mostly south of declination -42 deg). In addition to ringed galaxies, a list of 859 mostly nonringed galaxies intended for comparison with other catalogs is provided. Other findings from the CSRG that are not based on statistics are the identification of intrinsic bar/ring misalignment; bars which underfill inner rings; dimpling of R'1 pseudorings; pointy, rectangular, or hexagonal inner or outer ring shapes; a peculiar polar-ring-related system; and other extreme examples of spiral structure and ring morphology.

AB  - We investigate the morphological properties of 494 galaxies at z>1 from the GMASS survey, in their optical rest-frame, using HST/WFC3-IR images from CANDELS. The fractions of ellipticals and disks decline between z=1 to z=3, while at higher z the galaxy population is dominated by irregulars. Ellipticals have the highest concentration and Gini values, while irregulars assume the lowest ones. However, at 1<z<3, morphological parameters are not as effective in distinguishing the different Hubble types as they are at low z. No significant morphological k-correction was found to be required for the Hubble type classification. From a quantitative point of view, however, there are some differences between the optical and UV morphologies. Different morphological types occupy the two peaks of the (U-B) colour distribution: the majority of irregulars are found in the blue peak, while ellipticals mainly populate the red one. Disks have a smoother colour distribution. We also found that, in an UVJ diagram, the quiescent region is inhabited mainly by ellipticals and, to a less extent, by disks. Only 33% of all ellipticals in our sample are red and passively evolving galaxies, a percentage that is consistent with results obtained at z<1. There is a remarkable structural similarity between red and blue ellipticals: they share the same Hubble type and have consistent distributions of all morphological parameters, except asymmetry, with blue ellipticals being less asymmetric than red ones. We finally compared our morphological and spectroscopic classifications. Almost all irregulars have a star-forming spectrum. The majority of disks show signs of star-formation activity in their spectra, though in some cases their red continuum indicates the presence of older stellar populations. Finally, an elliptical morphology may be associated with either passively evolving or strongly star-forming galaxies.

AB  - The assembly of galaxies can be described by the distribution of their star formation as a function of cosmic time. Thanks to the WFC3 grism on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) it is now possible to measure this beyond the local Universe. Here we present the spatial distribution of Halpha emission for a sample of 54 strongly star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1 in the 3D-HST Treasury survey. By stacking the Halpha emission, we find that star formation occurred in approximately exponential distributions at z ~ 1, with a median Sérsic index of n = 1.0 $\pm$ 0.2. The stacks are elongated with median axis ratios of b/a = 0.58 $\pm$ 0.09 in Halpha consistent with (possibly thick) disks at random orientation angles. Keck spectra obtained for a subset of eight of the galaxies show clear evidence for rotation, with inclination corrected velocities of 90-330 km s--1. The most straightforward interpretation of our results is that star formation in strongly star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1 generally occurred in disks. The disks appear to be "scaled-up" versions of nearby spiral galaxies: they have EW(Halpha) ~ 100 Å out to the solar orbit and they have star formation surface densities above the threshold for driving galactic scale winds.

AB  - The causes of spiral structure in galaxies remain uncertain. Leaving aside the grand bisymmetric spirals with their own well-known complications, here we consider the possibility that multi-armed spiral features originate from density inhomogeneities orbiting within disks. Using high-resolution N-body simulations, we follow the motions of stars under the influence of gravity, and show that mass concentrations with properties similar to those of giant molecular clouds can induce the development of spiral arms through a process termed swing amplification. However, unlike in earlier work, we demonstrate that the eventual response of the disk can be highly non-linear, significantly modifying the formation and longevity of the resulting patterns. Contrary to expectations, ragged spiral structures can thus survive at least in a statistical sense long after the original perturbing influence has been removed.

AB  - The way galaxies assemble their mass to form the well-defined Hubble sequence is amongst the most debated topic in modern cosmology. One difficulty is to link distant galaxies, which emitted their light several Gyr ago, to those at present epoch. Such a link is affected by the evolution or the transformation of galaxies, as well as by numerous selection and observational biases. We aim to describe the galaxies of the Hubble sequence, 6 Gyr ago. We intend to derive a past Hubble sequence that can be causally linked to the present-day one, and further estimate the uncertainties of that method. We selected samples of nearby galaxies from the SDSS and of distant galaxies from the GOODS survey. We verified that each sample is representative of galaxies selected by a single criterion, e.g., MJ(AB) < -20.3. We further showed that the observational conditions needed to retrieve their morphological classification are similar in an unbiased way. Morphological analysis was done in an identical way for all galaxies in the two samples. We found that our single criterion is particularly appropriate to relating distant and nearby galaxies, either if gas is transformed to stars in relatively isolated galaxies or, alternatively, if they accrete significant amounts of gas from the intergalactic medium. Subsequent mergers during the elapsed 6 Gyr, as well as evolution of the stellar populations, are found to marginally affect the link between the past and the present Hubble sequence. Indeed, uncertainties from the above are below the errors due to the Poisson number statistics. We do find an absence of number evolution for elliptical and lenticular galaxies, which strikingly contrasts with the strong evolution of spiral and peculiar galaxies. Spiral galaxies were 2.3 times less abundant in the past, which is compensated exactly by the strong decrease by a factor 5 of peculiar galaxies. It strongly suggests that more than half of the present-day spirals had peculiar morphologies, 6 Gyr ago, and this has to be taken into account by any scenario of galactic disk evolution and formation. The past Hubble sequence can be used to test these scenarios and to test evolution of fundamental planes for spirals and bulges.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) have undergone dramatic structural evolution over the last 10 Gyr. A companion paper shows that nearby elliptical galaxies with M * >= 1.3 × 1011 M ☉ generically contain three photometric subcomponents: a compact inner component with effective radius Re <~ 1 kpc, an intermediate-scale middle component with Re ≈ 2.5 kpc, and an extended outer envelope with Re ≈ 10 kpc. Here we attempt to relate these substructures with the properties of ETGs observed at higher redshifts. We find that a hypothetical structure formed from combining the inner and middle components of local ellipticals follows a strikingly tight stellar mass-size relation, one that resembles the distribution of ETGs at z ≈ 1. Outside of the central kpc, the median stellar mass surface density profiles of this composite structure agree closest with those of massive galaxies that have similar cumulative number density at 1.5 < z < 2.0 within the uncertainty. We propose that the central substructures in nearby ellipticals are the evolutionary descendants of the "red nuggets" formed under highly dissipative ("wet") conditions at high redshifts, as envisioned in the initial stages of the two-phase formation scenario recently advocated for massive galaxies. Subsequent accretion, plausibly through dissipationless ("dry") minor mergers, builds the outer regions of the galaxy identified as the outer envelope in our decomposition. The large scatter exhibited by this component on the stellar mass-size plane testifies to the stochastic nature of the accretion events.

AB  - The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey that will eventually cover approximately one-quarter of the celestial sphere and collect spectra of ~106 galaxies, 100,000 quasars, 30,000 stars, and 30,000 serendipity targets. In 2001 June, the SDSS released to the general astronomical community its early data release, roughly 462 deg2 of imaging data including almost 14 million detected objects and 54,008 follow-up spectra. The imaging data were collected in drift-scan mode in five bandpasses (u, g, r, i, and z); our 95% completeness limits for stars are 22.0, 22.2, 22.2, 21.3, and 20.5, respectively. The photometric calibration is reproducible to 5%, 3%, 3%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. The spectra are flux- and wavelength-calibrated, with 4096 pixels from 3800 to 9200 Å at R~1800. We present the means by which these data are distributed to the astronomical community, descriptions of the hardware used to obtain the data, the software used for processing the data, the measured quantities for each observed object, and an overview of the properties of this data set.

AB  - Hidden in the bewildering details of galaxy morphology are clues to how galaxies formed and have evolved over a Hubble time. This article reviews the phenomenology of galaxy morphology and classification using an extensive set of illustrations to delineate as many types as possible and to show how different types connect to various physical processes and characteristics. The old classification systems are refined, and new types introduced, as the explosion in available morphological data has modified our views on the structure and evolution of galaxies.

AB  - We present new and stronger evidence for a previously reported relationship between galactic spiral arm pitch angle P (a measure of the tightness of spiral structure) and the mass M BH of a disk galaxy's nuclear supermassive black hole (SMBH). We use an improved method to accurately measure the spiral arm pitch angle in disk galaxies to generate quantitative data on this morphological feature for 34 galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. We find a relation of log (M/M ☉) = (8.21 $\pm$ 0.16) -- (0.062 $\pm$ 0.009)P. This method is compared with other means of estimating black hole mass to determine its effectiveness and usefulness relative to other existing relations. We argue that such a relationship is predicted by leading theories of spiral structure in disk galaxies, including the density wave theory. We propose this relationship as a tool for estimating SMBH masses in disk galaxies. This tool is potentially superior when compared to other methods for this class of galaxy and has the advantage of being unambiguously measurable from imaging data alone.

AB  - We derive improved versions of the relations between supermassive black hole mass (M BH) and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) and luminosity (L; the M-sigma and M-L relations), based on 49 M BH measurements and 19 upper limits. Particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter (epsilon0) in both relations. We find log(M BH/M sun) = alpha + betalog(sigma/200 km s-1) with (alpha, beta, epsilon0) = (8.12 $\pm$ 0.08, 4.24 $\pm$ 0.41, 0.44 $\pm$ 0.06) for all galaxies and (alpha, beta, epsilon0) = (8.23 $\pm$ 0.08, 3.96 $\pm$ 0.42, 0.31 $\pm$ 0.06) for ellipticals. The results for ellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatter recovered for spirals is significantly larger. The scatter inferred reinforces the need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass function based on the M-sigma relation, and further implies that there may be substantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the M-sigma relation. We estimate the M-L relationship as log(M BH/M sun) = alpha + betalog(LV /1011 L sun,V ) of (alpha, beta, epsilon0) = (8.95 $\pm$ 0.11, 1.11 $\pm$ 0.18, 0.38 $\pm$ 0.09); using only early-type galaxies. These results appear to be insensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and the distribution of intrinsic scatter. We show that culling the sample according to the resolution of the black hole's sphere of influence biases the relations to larger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.

AB  - We announce the discovery of a new Milky Way satellite Segue 2 found in the data of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE). We followed this up with deeper imaging and spectroscopy on the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT). From this, we derive a luminosity of Mv = -2.5, a half-light radius of 34 pc and a systemic velocity of ~ -40kms-1. Our data also provide evidence for a stream around Segue 2 at a similar heliocentric velocity, and the SEGUE data show that it is also present in neighbouring fields. We resolve the velocity dispersion of Segue 2 as 3.4 kms-1 and the possible stream as ~7kms-1. This object shows points of comparison with other recent discoveries, Segue 1, Boo II and Coma. We speculate that all four objects may be representatives of a population of satellites of satellites - survivors of accretion events that destroyed their larger but less dense parents. They are likely to have formed at redshifts z > 10 and are good candidates for fossils of the reionization epoch.

AB  - We present an evolutionary model for starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies in which mergers between gas-rich galaxies drive nuclear inflows of gas, producing starbursts and feeding the buried growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) until feedback expels gas and renders a briefly visible optical quasar. The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity, and we determine this dependence using a large set of galaxy merger simulations varying galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with peak luminosity, n dot(Lpeak,z). Quasars spend extended periods at luminosities well below peak, so n dot(Lpeak) has a maximum corresponding to the break'' in the observed luminosity function. From n dot(Lpeak) and our simulations, we obtain self-consistent hard and soft X-ray and optical luminosity functions and predict many observables at multiple redshifts, including column density distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the luminosity function of broad-line quasars in X-ray samples and broad-line fraction versus luminosity, active BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios, the mass function of relic BHs and total BH mass density, and the cosmic X-ray background. In every case, our predictions agree well with observed estimates, without invoking ad hoc assumptions about source properties or distributions. We provide a library of Monte Carlo realizations of our models for comparison with observations.

AB  - Accretion mechanisms for powering the central engines of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and possible sources of fuel are reviewed. It is a argued that the interstellar matter in the main body of the host galaxy is channeled toward the center, and the problem of angular momentum transport is addressed. Thin accretion disks are not a viable means of delivering fuel to luminous AGN on scales much larger than a parsec because of the long inflow time and effects of self-gravity. There are also serious obstacles to maintaining and regulating geometrically thick, hot accretion flows. The role of nonaxisymmetric perturbations of the gravitational potential on galactic scales and their triggers is emphasized. A unified model is outlined for fueling AGN, in which the inflow on large scales is driven by gravitational torques, and on small scales forms a mildly self-gravitating disk of clouds with inflow driven by magnetic torques or cloud-cloud collisions.

AB  - We investigate the connection between the presence of bars and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, using a volume-limited sample of ~9000 late-type galaxies with axis ratio b/a > 0.6 and Mr < -19.5 + 5 log h at low redshift (0.02 <= z <~ 0.055), selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. We find that the bar fraction in AGN-host galaxies (42.6%) is ~2.5 times higher than in non-AGN galaxies (15.6%), and that the AGN fraction is a factor of two higher in strong-barred galaxies (34.5%) than in non-barred galaxies (15.0%). However, these trends are simply caused by the fact that AGN-host galaxies are on average more massive and redder than non-AGN galaxies because the fraction of strong-barred galaxies (f SB) increases with u - r color and stellar velocity dispersion. When u - r color and velocity dispersion (or stellar mass) are fixed, both the excess of f SB in AGN-host galaxies and the enhanced AGN fraction in strong-barred galaxies disappears. Among AGN-host galaxies we find no strong difference of the Eddington ratio distributions between barred and non-barred systems. These results indicate that AGN activity is not dominated by the presence of bars, and that AGN power is not enhanced by bars. In conclusion, we do not find clear evidence that bars trigger AGN activity.

The exploration of its nature is now led by direct and indirect detection experiments, to be complemented by advances in the full range of cosmological tests, including judicious consideration of the rich phenomenology of galaxies. The results may confirm ideas about DM already under discussion. If we are lucky we also will be surprised once again.

AB  - Aims: With the aim of assessing the effects of bars on active galactic nuclei (AGN), we present an analysis of host characteristics and nuclear activity of active galaxies with and without bars.  Methods: We selected AGN host galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7), using the available emission-line fluxes. By visual inspection of SDSS images we classified the face-on spiral hosts of AGNs brighter than g-mag < 16.5 into barred or unbarred. With the purpose of providing an appropriate quantification of the effects of bars, we also constructed a suitable control sample of unbarred active galaxies with similar redshift, magnitude, morphology, bulge sizes, and local environment distributions.  Results: We find that the bar fraction, with respect to the full sample of spiral face-on AGN host galaxies, is 28.5%, in good agreement with previous works. barred AGN host galaxies show an excess of young stellar populations (as derived with the Dn(4000) spectral index), dominated by red u - r and g - r colors, with respect to the control sample, suggesting that bars produce an important effect on galaxy properties of AGN hosts. Regarding the nuclear activity distribution, we find that barred active galaxies show a shift toward higher Lum [OIII] values with respect to AGN without bars. In addition, we also find that this trend is more significant in less massive, younger stellar population and bluer AGN host galaxies. We found that the fraction of powerful AGN increases toward more massive hosts with bluer colors and younger stellar populations residing in denser environments. However, barred host AGN systematically show a higher fraction of powerful active nuclei galaxies with respect to the control sample. We also explored the accretion rate onto the central black holes, finding that barred AGN host show an excess of objects with high accretion rate values with respect to unbarred active galaxies.

AB  - Montage is a portable software toolkit for constructing custom, science-grade mosaics by composing multiple astronomical images. The mosaics constructed by Montage preserve the astrometry (position) and photometry (intensity) of the sources in the input images. The mosaic to be constructed is specified by the user in terms of a set of parameters, including dataset and wavelength to be used, location and size on the sky, coordinate system and projection, and spatial sampling rate. Many astronomical datasets are massive, and are stored in distributed archives that are, in most cases, remote with respect to the available computational resources. Montage can be run on both single- and multi-processor computers, including clusters and grids. Standard grid tools are used to run Montage in the case where the data or computers used to construct a mosaic are located remotely on the Internet. This paper describes the architecture, algorithms, and usage of Montage as both a software toolkit and as a grid portal. Timing results are provided to show how Montage performance scales with number of processors on a cluster computer. In addition, we compare the performance of two methods of running Montage in parallel on a grid.

AB  - To quantify the distribution of bar shapes in spiral galaxies, we have analysed 113 H-band and 89 B-band galaxy images from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey. Parameters measuring bar shape and position along the Hubble sequence were obtained in each waveband. Evidence was found for a bimodality in the distribution of bar shape, implying that barred and unbarred galaxies are not just the extrema of a single distribution, and that any evolution between these two states must occur on a rapid time-scale. Objective bar shapes measured in the H-band were found to be more closely related to visual classifications than B-band bar strengths, as the B-band images are somewhat compromised by localized star formation, especially in later type systems. Galaxies were found to be more centrally concentrated in the infrared. Later type galaxies showed greater asymmetry in the optical than the infrared, presumably again owing to localized star formation, but on average the bar shapes in the two bands were found to be the same.

AB  - The Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library (STIL) is a pure-Java, open source library for I/O and manipulation of tabular data such as astronomical catalogs.  It is designed to be high-performance and to cope with large tables. The core library is format-neutral, with the work of serialization and deserialization performed by pluggable format-specific I/O handlers. This means that the programmer seees a high-level abstraction of a table which is easy to work with, and also that support for new data formats can be added easily. Supplied handlers provide support for VOTables, FITS table extensions, relational databases via SQL and plain text tables, amongst others. The VOTable handler is believed to be the only existing library capable of reading or writing all the defined VOTable encoding formats (tabledata, fits, binary).  TOPCAT, based on STIL, is a user-friendly graphical program for viewing, analysis and editing of tables. It has facilities for plotting, cross matching, row selection, sorting and manipulation of data and metadata. Synthetic columns can be created and row selections made using a powerful and extensible algebraic expression language.

AB  - TOPCAT is an interactive graphical viewer and editor for tabular data. Its aim is to provide most of the facilities that astronomers need for analysis and manipulation of source catalogues and other tables, though it can be used for non-astronomical data as well. It understands a number of different astronomically important formats (including FITS and VOTable) and more formats can be added. It offers a variety of ways to view and analyse tables, including a browser for the cell data themselves, viewers for information about table and column metadata, and facilities for 1-, 2-, 3- and higher-dimensional visualisation, calculating statistics and joining tables using flexible matching algorithms. Using a powerful and extensible Java-based expression language new columns can be defined and row subsets selected for separate analysis. Table data and metadata can be edited and the resulting modified table can be written out in a wide range of output formats. It is a stand-alone application which works quite happily with no network connection. However, because it uses Virtual Observatory (VO) standards, it can cooperate smoothly with other tools in the VO world and beyond, such as VODesktop, Aladin and ds9. Between 2006 and 2009 TOPCAT was developed within the AstroGrid project, and is offered as part of a standard suite of applications on the AstroGrid web site, where you can find information on several other VO tools. The program is written in pure Java and available under the GNU General Public Licence. It has been developed in the UK within the now-terminated Starlink and AstroGrid projects, and under PPARC and STFC grants. Its underlying table processing facilities are provided by STIL.

AB  - A galaxy classification system is proposed in which normal spirals and lenticulars form parallel sequences within which 'early' and 'late' systems are distinguished by means of their disk-to-bulge ratios. A sequence of 'anemic spirals', which occur most frequently in rich clusters, is found to have characteristics that are intermediate between those of vigorous gas-rich normal spirals and gas-poor systems of type S0. The differences between normal spirals (Sa-Sb-Sc), anemic spirals (Aa-Ab-Ac), and lenticulars (S0a-S0b-S0c) are tentatively interpreted in terms of the influence of environment on the evolution of flattened galaxies.

Hubble took these terms from spectral classification of stars to signify a sequence related to complexity of appearance, albeit based on images, not spectra. The temporal connotations had been abandoned before his 1926 paper on classification of galaxies.

AB  - We live in a universe filled with galaxies with an amazing variety of sizes and shapes. One of the biggest challenges for astronomers working in this field is to understand how all these types relate to each other in the background of an expanding universe. Modern astronomical surveys (like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey) have revolutionised this field of astronomy, by providing vast numbers of galaxies to study. The sheer size of the these databases made traditional visual classification of the types galaxies impossible and in 2007 inspired the Galaxy Zoo project (www.galaxyzoo.org); starting the largest ever scientific collaboration by asking members of the public to help classify galaxies by type and shape. Galaxy Zoo has since shown itself, in a series of now more than 30 scientific papers, to be a fantastic database for the study of galaxy evolution. In this Invited Discourse I spoke a little about the historical background of our understanding of what galaxies are, of galaxy classification, about our modern view of galaxies in the era of large surveys. I finish with showcasing some of the contributions galaxy classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project are making to our understanding of galaxy evolution. This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 200,000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. Their contributions are individually acknowledged at http://www.galaxyzoo.org/volunteers.

AB  - Citizen science, in which volunteers work with professional scientists to conduct research, is expanding due to large online datasets. To plan projects, it is important to understand volunteers' motivations for participating. This paper analyzes results from an online survey of nearly 11,000 volunteers in Galaxy Zoo, an astronomy citizen science project. Results show that volunteers' primary motivation is a desire to contribute to scientific research. We encourage other citizen science projects to study the motivations of their volunteers, to see whether and how these results may be generalized to inform the field of citizen science.

AB  - We study ˜330 massive (M* > 109.5 M&sun;), newborn spheroidal galaxies (SGs) around the epoch of peak star formation (1 < z < 3) to explore the high-redshift origin of SGs and gain insight into when and how the old stellar populations that dominate today's Universe formed. The sample is drawn from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 Early-Release Science programme, which provides deep 10-filter (0.2-1.7 mum) HST imaging over one-third of the GOODS-South field. We find that the star formation episodes that built our SGs likely peaked in the redshift range 2 < z < 5 (with a median of z ˜ 3) and have decay time-scales shorter than ˜1.5 Gyr. Starburst time-scales and ages show no trend with stellar mass in the range 109.5 < M* < 1010.5 M&sun;. However, the time-scales show increased scatter towards lower values (<0.3 Gyr) for M* > 1010.5 M&sun;, and an age trend becomes evident in this mass regime: SGs with M* > 1011.5 M&sun; are ˜2 Gyr older than their counterparts with M* < 1010.5 M&sun;. Nevertheless, a smooth downsizing trend with galaxy mass is not observed, and the large scatter in starburst ages indicates that SGs are not a particularly coeval population. Around half of the blue SGs appear not to drive their star formation via major mergers, and those that have experienced a recent major merger show only modest enhancements (˜40 per cent) in their specific star formation rates. Our empirical study indicates that processes other than major mergers (e.g. violent disc instability driven by cold streams and/or minor mergers) likely play a dominant role in building SGs, and creating a significant fraction of the old stellar populations that dominate today's Universe.

AB  - We explore the properties of dust and associated molecular gas in 352 nearby (0.01 < z < 0.07) early-type galaxies (ETGs) with prominent dust lanes, drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Two-thirds of these 'dusty ETGs' (D-ETGs) are morphologically disturbed, which suggests a merger origin, making these galaxies ideal test beds for studying the merger process at low redshift. The D-ETGs preferentially reside in lower density environments, compared to a control sample drawn from the general ETG population. Around 80 per cent of D-ETGs inhabit the field (compared to 60 per cent of the control ETGs) and less than 2 per cent inhabit clusters (compared to 10 per cent of the control ETGs). Compared to their control-sample counterparts, D-ETGs exhibit bluer ultraviolet-optical colours (indicating enhanced levels of star formation) and an active galactic nucleus fraction that is more than an order of magnitude greater (indicating a strikingly higher incidence of nuclear activity). The mass of clumpy dust residing in large-scale dust features is estimated, using the SDSS r-band images, to be in the range 104.5-106.5 M&sun;. A comparison to the total (clumpy + diffuse) dust masses - calculated using the far-infrared fluxes of 15 per cent of the D-ETGs that are detected by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) - indicates that only 20 per cent of the dust is typically contained in these large-scale dust features. The dust masses are several times larger than the maximum value expected from stellar mass loss, ruling out an internal origin. The dust content shows no correlation with the blue luminosity, indicating that it is not related to a galactic scale cooling flow. Furthermore, no correlation is found with the age of the recent starburst, suggesting that the dust is accreted directly in the merger rather than being produced in situ by the triggered star formation. Using molecular gas-to-dust ratios of ETGs in the literature, we estimate that the median current molecular gas fraction in the IRAS-detected ETGs is ˜1.3 per cent. Adopting reasonable values for gas depletion time-scales and starburst ages, the median initial gas fraction in these D-ETGs is ˜4 per cent. Recent work has suggested that the merger activity in nearby ETGs largely involves minor mergers (dry ETG + gas-rich dwarf), with mass ratios between 1:10 and 1:4. If the IRAS-detected D-ETGs have formed via this channel, then the original gas fractions of the accreted satellites are between 20 and 44 per cent. This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 250 000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. Their contributions are individually acknowledged at .

AB  - We present a statistical observational study of the tidal dwarf (TD) population in the nearby Universe by exploiting a large, homogeneous catalogue of galaxy mergers compiled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. 95 per cent of TD-producing mergers involve two spiral progenitors (typically both in the blue cloud), while most remaining systems have at least one spiral progenitor. The fraction of TD-producing mergers where both parents are early-type galaxies is less than 2 per cent, suggesting that TDs are unlikely to form in such mergers. The bulk of TD-producing mergers inhabit a field environment and have mass ratios greater than ˜1:7 (the median value is 1:2.5). TDs forming at the tidal-tail tips are ˜4 times more massive than those forming at the base of the tails. TD stellar masses are less than 10 per cent of the stellar masses of their parents (the median is 0.6 per cent) and lie within 15 optical half-light radii of their parent galaxies. The TD population is typically bluer than the parents, with a median offset of ˜0.3 mag in the (g - r) colour and the TD colours are not affected by the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in their parents. An analysis of their star formation histories indicates that TDs contain both newly formed stars (with a median age of ˜30 Myr) and old stars drawn from the parent discs, each component probably contributing roughly equally to the stellar mass of the object. Thus TDs are not formed purely through gas condensation in tidal tails but host a significant component of old stars from the parent discs. Finally, an analysis of the TD contribution to the observed dwarf-to-massive galaxy ratio in the local Universe indicates that ˜6 per cent of dwarfs in nearby clusters may have a tidal origin, if TD production rates in nearby mergers are representative of those in the high-redshift Universe. Even if TD production rates at high redshift were several factors higher, it seems unlikely that the entire dwarf galaxy population today is a result of merger activity over the lifetime of the Universe.

AB  - We describe the algorithm that selects the main sample of galaxies for spectroscopy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) from the photometric data obtained by the imaging survey. Galaxy photometric properties are measured using the Petrosian magnitude system, which measures flux in apertures determined by the shape of the surface brightness profile. The metric aperture used is essentially independent of cosmological surface brightness dimming, foreground extinction, sky brightness, and the galaxy central surface brightness. The main galaxy sample consists of galaxies with r-band Petrosian magnitudes r<=17.77 and r-band Petrosian half-light surface brightnesses mu50<=24.5 mag arcsec-2. These cuts select about 90 galaxy targets per square degree, with a median redshift of 0.104. We carry out a number of tests to show that (1) our star-galaxy separation criterion is effective at eliminating nearly all stellar contamination while removing almost no genuine galaxies, (2) the fraction of galaxies eliminated by our surface brightness cut is very small (~0.1%), (3) the completeness of the sample is high, exceeding 99%, and (4) the reproducibility of target selection based on repeated imaging scans is consistent with the expected random photometric errors. The main cause of incompleteness is blending with saturated stars, which becomes more significant for brighter, larger galaxies. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio (S/N>4 per pixel) that essentially all targeted galaxies (99.9%) yield a reliable redshift (i.e., with statistical error less than 30 km s-1). About 6% of galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria are not observed because they have a companion closer than the 55" minimum separation of spectroscopic fibers, but these galaxies can be accounted for in statistical analyses of clustering or galaxy properties. The uniformity and completeness of the galaxy sample make it ideal for studies of large-scale structure and the characteristics of the galaxy population in the local universe.

AB  - The Early Data Release (EDR) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey provides one of the largest multicolor photometric catalogs currently available to the astronomical community. In this paper we present the first application of photometric redshifts to the ~6 million extended sources in these data (with 1.8 million sources having r'<21). Utilizing a range of photometric redshift techniques, from empirical to template and hybrid techniques, we investigate the statistical and systematic uncertainties present in the redshift estimates for the EDR data. For r'<21, we find that the redshift estimates provide realistic redshift histograms with an rms uncertainty in the photometric redshift relation of 0.035 at r'<18 and rising to 0.1 at r'<21. We conclude by describing how these photometric redshifts and derived quantities, such as spectral type, rest-frame colors, and absolute magnitudes, are stored in the SDSS database. We provide sample queries for searching on photometric redshifts and list the current caveats and issues that should be understood before using these photometric redshifts in statistical analyses of the SDSS galaxies.

AB  - We have carried out a search for 18-cm OH megamaser (OHM) emission with the Green Bank Telescope. The targeted galaxies comprise a sample of 121 ULIRGs at 0.09<z<1.5, making this is the first large, systematic search for OHMs at z>0.25. Nine new detections of OHMs are reported, all at redshifts z<0.25. For the remainder of the galaxies, observations constrain the upper limit on OH emission; this rules out OHMs of moderate brightness (LOH >103 L&sun;) for 26% of the sample, and extremely bright OHM emission (LOH >104 L&sun;) for 73% of the sample. Losses from RFI result in the OHM detection fraction being significantly lower than expected for galaxies with LIR >1012 L&sun;. The new OHM detections are used to calculate an updated OH luminosity function, with Phi~ LOH  -0.66 this slope is in agreement with previous results. Non-detections of OHMs in the COSMOS field constrain the predicted sky density of OHMs; the results are consistent with a galaxy merger rate evolving as (1+z) m , where m<=6.

AB  - Identifying interesting relationships between pairs of variables in large data sets is increasingly important. Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R2) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships.

This 3% error bar is the most precise for an extra-galactic black hole and is close to the precision obtained for Sgr A* in the Milky Way. The factor 7 improvement over the previous measurement is entirely due to correction of a mathematical error, an error that I suggest may be common among astronomers.

AB  - For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the alphabet'' used to describe those systems.

AB  - Galactic bars are often suspected to be channels of gas inflow to the galactic center and to trigger central star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. However, the current status on this issue based on empirical studies is unsettling, especially regarding AGNs. We investigate this question based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. From the nearby (0.01 < z < 0.05) bright (M r < -19) database, we have constructed a sample of 6658 relatively face-on late-type galaxies through visual inspection. We found 36% of them to have a bar. Bars are found to be more common in galaxies with earlier morphology. This makes sample selection critical. Parameter-based selections would miss a large fraction of barred galaxies of early morphology. Bar effects on star formation or AGNs are difficult to understand properly because multiple factors (bar frequency, stellar mass, black hole mass, gas contents, etc.) seem to contribute to them in intricate manners. In the hope of breaking these degeneracies, we inspect bar effects for fixed galaxy properties. Bar effects on central star formation seem higher in redder galaxies. Bar effects on AGNs on the other hand are higher in bluer and less massive galaxies. These effects seem more pronounced with increasing bar length. We discuss possible implications in terms of gas contents, bar strength, bar evolution, fueling timescale, and the dynamical role of supermassive black hole.

AB  - We use the ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies to study the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, Psi, defined as the angle between the photometric and kinematic major axes. We find that 71 per cent of nearby early-type galaxies are strictly aligned systems (Psi<= 5$\,^\circ$), an additional 14 per cent have 5$\,^\circ$ < Psi<= 10$\,^\circ$ and 90 per cent of galaxies have Psi<= 15$\,^\circ$. Taking into account measurement uncertainties, 90 per cent of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5$\,^\circ$, suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (˜10 per cent) are not consistent with the axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. We identify morphological features such as bars and rings (30 per cent), dust structures (16 per cent), blue nuclear colours (6 per cent) and evidence of interactions (8 per cent) visible on ATLAS3D galaxies. We use KINEMETRY to analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies into two broad types of regular and non-regular rotators. We find 82 per cent of regular rotators and 17 per cent of non-regular rotators, with two galaxies that we were not able to classify due to the poor data quality. The non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions and are massive. We characterize the specific features in the mean velocity and velocity dispersion maps. The majority of galaxies do not have any specific features, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinct cores (7 per cent of galaxies) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4 per cent of galaxies). We separate galaxies into five kinematic groups based on the kinemetric features, which are then used to interpret the (Psi-ε) diagram. Most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and are non-regular rotators. In addition, some show evidence of the interaction and might not be in equilibrium, while some are barred. While the trends are weak, there is a tendency that large values of Psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities and among the most massive galaxies in the sample. Taking into account the kinematic alignment and the kinemetric analysis, the majority of early-type galaxies have velocity maps more similar to that of the spiral discs than to that of the remnants of equal-mass mergers. We suggest that the most common formation mechanism for early-type galaxies preserves the axisymmetry of the disc progenitors and their general kinematic properties. Less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with much lower net angular momentum.

AB  - In Paper I of this series we introduced a volume-limited parent sample of 871 galaxies from which we extracted the ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs). In Papers II and III we classified the ETGs using their stellar kinematics, in a way that is nearly insensitive to the projection effects, and we separated them into fast and slow rotators. Here we look at galaxy morphology and note that the edge-on fast rotators generally are lenticular galaxies. They appear like spiral galaxies with the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals (E5 or flatter) with discy isophotes. Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of bulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder (E4 or rounder, except for counter-rotating discs) and are generally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical galaxies. We propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by Hubble as it gives a misleading description of ETGs by ignoring the large variation in the bulge sizes of fast rotators. Motivated by the fact that only one third (34 per cent) of the ellipticals in our sample are slow rotators, we study for the first time the kinematic morphology-density T-Sigma relation using fast and slow rotators to replace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than using classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density environments [? per cent] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR) ≈ 4 per cent] of the total galaxy population in the relatively low-density environments explored by our survey, with the exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR) ≈ 20 per cent]. This contrasts with the classic studies that invariably find significant fractions of (misclassified) ellipticals down to the lowest environmental densities. We find a clean log-linear relation between the fraction f(Sp) of spiral galaxies and the local galaxy surface density Sigma3, within a cylinder enclosing the three nearest galaxies. This holds for nearly four orders of magnitude in the surface density down to Sigma3≈ 0.01 Mpc-2, with f(Sp) decreasing by 10 per cent per dex in Sigma3, while f(FR) correspondingly increases. The existence of a smooth kinematic T-Sigma relation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment, like e.g. ram-pressure stripping, as main contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast rotators in low-density environments. It shows that the segregation is driven by local effects at the small-group scale. This is supported by the relation becoming shallower when using a surface density estimator Sigma10 with a cluster scale. Only at the largest densities in the Virgo core does the f(Sp) relation break down and steepen sharply, while the fraction of slow rotators starts to significantly increase. This suggests that a different mechanism is at work there, possibly related to the stripping of the gas from spirals by the hot intergalactic medium in the cluster core and the corresponding lack of cold accretion.

AB  - Planet Hunters is a new citizen science project designed to engage the public in an exoplanet search using NASA Kepler public release data. In the first month after launch, users identified two new planet candidates which survived our checks for false positives. The follow-up effort included analysis of Keck HIRES spectra of the host stars, analysis of pixel centroid offsets in the Kepler data and adaptive optics imaging at Keck using NIRC2. Spectral synthesis modelling coupled with stellar evolutionary models yields a stellar density distribution, which is used to model the transit orbit. The orbital periods of the planet candidates are 9.8844 $\pm$ 0.0087 d (KIC 10905746) and 49.7696 $\pm$ 0.000 39 d (KIC 6185331), and the modelled planet radii are 2.65 and 8.05 R⊕. The involvement of citizen scientists as part of Planet Hunters is therefore shown to be a valuable and reliable tool in exoplanet detection. This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 40 000 volunteers in the Planet Hunters project. Their contributions are individually acknowledged at .

AB  - We present a new database of absorption and emission-line measurements based on the entire spectral atlas from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) 7th data release of galaxies within a redshift of 0.2. Our work makes use of the publicly available penalized pixel-fitting (pPXF) and gas and absorption line fitting (gandalf) IDL codes, aiming to improve the existing measurements for stellar kinematics, the strength of various absorption-line features, and the flux and width of the emissions from different species of ionized gas. Our fit to the stellar continuum uses both standard stellar population models and empirical templates obtained by combining a large number of stellar spectra in order to fit a subsample of high-quality SDSS spectra for quiescent galaxies. Furthermore, our fit to the nebular spectrum includes an exhaustive list of both recombination and forbidden lines. Foreground Galactic extinction is implicitly treated in our models, whereas reddening in the SDSS galaxies is included in the form of a simple dust screen component affecting the entire spectrum that is accompanied by a second reddening component affecting only the ionized gas emission. In order to check for systematic departures from the rather standard set of assumptions that enters our models, we provide a quality assessment for our fit to the SDSS spectra in our sample, for both the stellar continuum and the nebular emissions and across different wavelength regions. This quality assessment also allows the identification of objects with either problematic data or peculiar features. We hope to foster the discovery potential of our database; therefore, our spectral fit is available to the community. For example, based on the quality assessment around the Halpha and [N II] lambda6584 lines, approximately 1% of the SDSS spectra classified as "galaxies" by the SDSS pipeline do in fact require additional broad lines to be matched, even though they do not show a strong continuum from an active nucleus, as do the SDSS objects classified as "quasars." Finally, we provide new spectral templates for galaxies of different Hubble types, obtained by combining the results of our spectral fit for a subsample of 452 morphologically selected objects.

AB  - We update van den Bergh's parallel-sequence galaxy classification in which S0 galaxies form a sequence S0a-S0b-S0c that parallels the sequence Sa-Sb-Sc of spiral galaxies. The ratio B/T of bulge-to-total light defines the position of a galaxy in this tuning-fork diagram. Our classification makes one major improvement. We extend the S0a-S0b-S0c sequence to spheroidal ("Sph") galaxies that are positioned in parallel to irregular galaxies in a similarly extended Sa-Sb-Sc-Im sequence. This provides a natural "home" for spheroidals, which previously were omitted from galaxy classification schemes or inappropriately combined with ellipticals. To motivate our juxtaposition of Sph and Im galaxies, we present photometry and bulge-disk decompositions of four rare, late-type S0s that bridge the gap between the more common S0b and Sph galaxies. NGC 4762 is an edge-on SB0bc galaxy with a very small classical-bulge-to-total ratio of B/T = 0.13 $\pm$ 0.02. NGC 4452 is an edge-on SB0 galaxy with an even tinier pseudobulge-to-total ratio of PB/T = 0.017 $\pm$ 0.004. It is therefore an SB0c. VCC 2048, whose published classification is S0, contains an edge-on disk, but its "bulge" plots in the structural parameter sequence of spheroidals. It is therefore a disky Sph. And NGC 4638 is similarly a "missing link" between S0s and Sphs---it has a tiny bulge and an edge-on disk embedded in an Sph halo. In the Appendix, we present photometry and bulge-disk decompositions of all Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys Virgo Cluster Survey S0s that do not have published decompositions. We use these data to update the structural parameter correlations of Sph, S+Im, and E galaxies. We show that Sph galaxies of increasing luminosity form a continuous sequence with the disks (but not bulges) of S0c-S0b-S0a galaxies. Remarkably, the Sph-S0-disk sequence is almost identical to that of Im galaxies and spiral galaxy disks. We review published observations for galaxy transformation processes, particularly ram-pressure stripping of cold gas. We suggest that Sph galaxies are transformed, "red and dead" Scd-Im galaxies in the same way that many S0 galaxies are transformed, red and dead Sa-Sc spiral galaxies.

AB  - We present an atlas of Ks-band images of 206 early-type galaxies, including 160 S0-S0/a galaxies, 12 ellipticals and 33 Sa galaxies (+ one later type). The majority of the atlas galaxies belong to a magnitude-limited (mB <= 12.5 mag) sample of 185 Near-InfraRed S0 Survey galaxies. To ensure that misclassified S0s are not omitted, 25 ellipticals from the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies classified as S0s in the Carnegie Atlas were included in the sample. The observations were carried out using 3-4  m class telescopes with subarcsecond pixel resolution (˜0.25 arcsec), and were obtained in good seeing conditions (full width at half-maximum ˜1 arcsec). The images are 2-3  mag deeper than Two-Micron All-Sky Survey images, allowing the detection of faint outer discs in S0s. Both visual and photometric classifications are made, largely following the classification criteria of de Vaucouleurs. Special attention is paid to the classification of lenses, which are coded in a more systematic manner than in any of the previous studies. A new lens type, called a 'barlens', is introduced, possibly forming part of the bar itself. Also, boxy/peanut/x-shaped structures are identified in many barred galaxies, even though the galaxies are not seen edge-on, indicating that vertical thickening is not enough to explain these structures. Photometric classification includes detection of exponential outer discs or other structures not directly visible in the images, but becoming clear in unsharp masking or residual images in decompositions. In our photometric classification, nuclear bars are assigned for 15 galaxies, which are overshadowed by bulges in visual classification. The mean Hubble stage in the near-infrared is found to be similar to that in the optical. We give dimensions of structure components, and radial profiles of the position angles and ellipticities, and show deviations from perfect elliptical isophotes. Shells and ripples, generally assumed to be manifestations of recent mergers, are detected only in six galaxies. However, multiple lenses appear in as much as 25 per cent of the atlas galaxies, which is a challenge to the hierarchical evolutionary picture of galaxies. Such models need to explain how the lenses were formed and then survived in multiple merger events that galaxies may have suffered during their lifetimes.

AB  - ImgCutout is a Web application that enables professional astronomers and the general public to interactively visualize and explore large, complex astronomical data sets. The application consists of a Web interface that calls a Web service, which accesses SkyServer, a 1 TB SQL Server database containing catalog data for 100 million objects, spectra and images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. ImgCutout builds, in real time, color mosaic-images of user-selected regions of the sky, and overlays additional information about astronomical and spatial objects in the database including: boundaries of survey fields and aperture plates, outlines of individual objects and data quality masks, in addition to locations of photometric and spectroscopic objects. The tool can search for lists of known objects, allows new database queries, and provides detailed information about selected objects.

AB  - We use a large sample of 174 Wolf-Rayet (W-R) galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study whether and how the slope of the stellar initial mass function depends on metallicity. We calculate for each object its oxygen abundance, according to which we divide our sample into four metallicity subsamples. For each subsample, we then measure three quantities: the equivalent width of the Hbeta emission line, the equivalent width of the W-R bump around 4650 Å, and the W-R bump-to-Hbeta intensity ratio, and compare to the predictions of the same quantities by evolutionary synthesis models of Schaerer & Vacca. Such comparisons lead to a clear dependence of the slope of initial mass function (alpha) on metallicity in that galaxies at higher metallicities tend to have steeper initial mass functions, with the slope index ranging from alpha~1.00 for the lowest metallicity, Z=0.001, to alpha~3.30 for the highest metallicity, Z=0.02. We have carefully examined the possible sources of systematic error, either in models or in our observational measurements, and have shown that these sources do not change this result.

AB  - No modern astronomer made a more profound contribution to our understanding  of the cosmos than did Edwin Hubble, who first conclusively demonstrated that  the universe is expanding.  Basing his theory on the observation of the  change in spectra of distant galaxies, called red shift, Hubble showed that  this is a Doppler effect, or alteration in the wavelength of light, resulting  from the rapid motion of celestial objects away from Earth.  Hubble's discovery confirmed an equation previously arrived at by Einstein --  who, however, had not trusted his own figures until Hubble proved their  accuracy.  Hubble supported his theory with careful measurements, but found a  rate of expansion (called Hubble's constant) that was far too high because he  assumed that other galaxies were much nearer our Milky Way than they are.   On the other hand, Hubble's law, relating the distance of a galaxy to its  recession velocity, remains essentially unchanged.   In 1935 Hubble described his principal observations and conclusions in the  Silliman lectures at Yale University.  These lectures were published the  following year as The Realm of the Nebulae, which quickly became a classic  work.  It is here reprinted with an introduction by James E. Gunn.

AB  - We present the Advanced Camera for Surveys General Catalog (ACS-GC), a photometric and morphological database using publicly available data obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope. The goal of the ACS-GC database is to provide a large statistical sample of galaxies with reliable structural and distance measurements to probe the evolution of galaxies over a wide range of look-back times. The ACS-GC includes approximately 470,000 astronomical sources (stars + galaxies) derived from the AEGIS, COSMOS, GEMS, and GOODS surveys. GALAPAGOS was used to construct photometric (SEXTRACTOR) and morphological (GALFIT) catalogs. The analysis assumes a single Sérsic model for each object to derive quantitative structural parameters. We include publicly available redshifts from the DEEP2, COMBO-17, TKRS, PEARS, ACES, CFHTLS, and zCOSMOS surveys to supply redshifts (spectroscopic and photometric) for a considerable fraction (~74%) of the imaging sample. The ACS-GC includes color postage stamps, GALFIT residual images, and photometry, structural parameters, and redshifts combined into a single catalog.

AB  - We follow the formation and evolution of bars in N-body simulations of disc galaxies with gas and/or a triaxial halo. We find that both the relative gas fraction and the halo shape play a major role in the formation and evolution of the bar. In gas-rich simulations, the disc stays near-axisymmetric much longer than in gas-poor ones, and, when the bar starts growing, it does so at a much slower rate. Because of these two effects combined, large-scale bars form much later in gas-rich than in gas-poor discs. This can explain the observation that bars are in place earlier in massive red disc galaxies than in blue spirals. We also find that the morphological characteristics in the bar region are strongly influenced by the gas fraction. In particular, the bar at the end of the simulation is much weaker in gas-rich cases. The quality of our simulations is such as to allow us to discuss the question of bar longevity because the resonances are well resolved and the number of gas particles is sufficient to describe the gas flow adequately. In no case did we find a bar which was destroyed.  Halo triaxiality has a dual influence on bar strength. In the very early stages of the simulation it induces bar formation to start earlier. On the other hand, during the later, secular evolution phase, triaxial haloes lead to considerably less increase of the bar strength than spherical ones. The shape of the halo evolves considerably with time. We confirm previous results of gas-less simulations that find that the inner part of an initially spherical halo can become elongated and develop a halo bar. However we also show that, on the contrary, in gas-rich simulations, the inner parts of an initially triaxial halo can become rounder with time. The main body of initially triaxial haloes evolves towards sphericity, but in initially strongly triaxial cases it stops well short of becoming spherical. Part of the angular momentum absorbed by the halo generates considerable rotation of the halo particles that stay located relatively near the disc for long periods of time. Another part generates halo bulk rotation, which, contrary to that of the bar, increases with time but stays small. Thus, in our models there are two non-axisymmetric components rotating with different pattern speeds, namely the halo and the bar, so that the resulting dynamics have strong similarities to the dynamics of double bar systems.

AB  - We study the evolution of galactic bars and the link with disk and spheroid formation in a sample of zoom-in cosmological simulations. Our simulation sample focuses on galaxies with present-day stellar masses in the 1010-1011 M &sun; range, in field and loose group environments, with a broad variety of mass growth histories. In our models, bars are almost absent from the progenitors of present-day spirals at z > 1.5, and they remain rare and generally too weak to be observable down to z ≈ 1. After this characteristic epoch, the fractions of observable and strong bars rise rapidly, bars being present in 80% of spiral galaxies and easily observable in two thirds of these at z <= 0.5. This is quantitatively consistent with the redshift evolution of the observed bar fraction, although the latter is presently known up to z ≈ 0.8 because of band-shifting and resolution effects. Our models hence predict that the decrease in the bar fraction with increasing redshift should continue with a fraction of observable bars not larger than 10%-15% in disk galaxies at z > 1. Our models also predict later bar formation in lower-mass galaxies, in agreement with existing data. We find that the characteristic epoch of bar formation, namely redshift z ≈ 0.8-1 in the studied mass range, corresponds to the epoch at which today's spirals acquire their disk-dominated morphology. At higher redshift, disks tend to be rapidly destroyed by mergers and gravitational instabilities and rarely develop significant bars. We hence suggest that the bar formation epoch corresponds to the transition between an early "violent" phase of spiral galaxy formation at z >= 1 and a late "secular" phase at z <= 0.8. In the secular phase, the presence of bars substantially contributes to the growth of the (pseudo-)bulge, but the bulge mass budget remains statistically dominated by the contribution of mergers, interactions, and disk instabilities at high redshift. Early bars at z > 1 are often short-lived, while most of the bars formed at z <= 1 persist down to z = 0, late cosmological gas infall being necessary to maintain some of them.

AB  - This contribution gives the results of a statistical investigation of 400 extragalactic nebulae for which Holetschek has determined total visual magnitudes. The list is complete for the brighter nebulae in the northern sky and is representative to 12.5 mag. or fainter. The classification employed is based on the forms of the photographic images. About 3 per cent are irregular, but the remaining nebulae fall into a sequence of type forms characterized by rotational symmetry about dominating nuclei. The sequence is composed of two sections, the elliptical nebulae and the spirals, which merge into each other. Luminosity relations. - The distribution of magnitudes appears to be uniform throughout the sequence. For each type or stage in the sequence, the total magnitudes are related to the logarithms of the maximum diameters by the formula, mT = C - 5 log d, where C varies progressively from type to type, indicating a variation in diameter for a given magnitude or vice versa. By applying corrections to C, the nebulae can be reduced to a standard type and then a single formula expresses the relation for all nebulae from the Magellanic Clouds to the faintest that can be classified. When the minor diameter is used, the value of C is approximately constant throughout the entire sequence. The coefficient of log d corresponds with the inverse-square law, which suggests that the nebulae are all of the same order of absolute luminosity and that apparent magnitudes are measures of distance. This hypothesis is supported by similar results for the nuclear magnitudes and the magnitudes of the brightest stars involved, and by the small range in luminosities among nebulae whose distances are already known. Distances and absolute dimensions. - The mean absolute visual magnitude, as derived from the nebulae whose distances are known, is -15.2. The statistical expression for the distance in parsecs is then log D = 4.04 + 0.2 mT. where mT is the total apparent magnitude. This leads to mean values for absolute dimensions at various stages in the sequence of types. Masses appear to be of the order of 2.6x108 Msun. Distribution and density of space. - To apparent magnitude about 16.7, corresponding to an exposure of one hour on fast plates with the 60-inch reflector, the numbers of nebulae to various limits of total magnitude vary directly with the volumes of space represented by the limits. This indicates an approximately uniform density of space, of the order of one nebula per 1017 cubic parsecs or 1.5x10-31 in C.G.S. units. The corresponding radius of curvature of the finite universe of general relativity is of the order of 2.7x1010 parsecs, or about 600 times the distance at which normal nebulae can be detected with the 100-inch reflector.

AB  - We analyze a suite of 33 cosmological simulations of the evolution of Milky-Way-mass galaxies in low-density environments. Our sample spans a broad range of Hubble types at z = 0, from nearly bulgeless disks to bulge-dominated galaxies. Despite the fact that a large fraction of the bulge is typically in place by z ~ 1, we find no significant correlation between the morphology at z = 1 and at z = 0. The z = 1 progenitors of disk galaxies span a range of morphologies, including smooth disks, unstable disks, interacting galaxies, and bulge-dominated systems. By z ~ 0.5, spiral arms and bars are largely in place and the progenitor morphology is correlated with the final morphology. We next focus on late-type galaxies with a bulge-to-total ratio (B/T) <0.3 at z = 0. These show a correlation between B/T at z = 0 and the mass ratio of the largest merger at z < 2, as well as with the gas accretion rate at z > 1. We find that the galaxies with the lowest B/T tend to have a quiet baryon input history, with no major mergers at z < 2, and with a low and constant gas accretion rate that keeps a stable angular-momentum direction. More violent merger or gas accretion histories lead to galaxies with more prominent bulges. Most disk galaxies have a bulge Sérsic index n <= 2. The galaxies with the highest bulge Sérsic index tend to have histories of intense gas accretion and disk instability rather than active mergers.

AB  - The Universe is in transition. At early times, galactic evolution was dominated by hierarchical clustering and merging, processes that are violent and rapid. In the far future, evolution will mostly be secular the slow rearrangement of energy and mass that results from interactions involving collective phenomena such as bars, oval disks, spiral structure, and triaxial dark halos. Both processes are important now. This review discusses internal secular evolution, concentrating on one important consequence, the buildup of dense central components in disk galaxies that look like classical, merger-built bulges but that were made slowly out of disk gas. We call these pseudobulges.

AB  - Dwarf satellite galaxies are thought to be the remnants of the population of primordial structures that coalesced to form giant galaxies like the Milky Way. It has previously been suspected that dwarf galaxies may not be isotropically distributed around our Galaxy, because several are correlated with streams of HI emission, and may form coplanar groups. These suspicions are supported by recent analyses. It has been claimed that the apparently planar distribution of satellites is not predicted within standard cosmology, and cannot simply represent a memory of past coherent accretion. However, other studies dispute this conclusion. Here we report the existence of a planar subgroup of satellites in the Andromeda galaxy (M31), comprising about half of the population. The structure is at least 400kiloparsecs in diameter, but also extremely thin, with a perpendicular scatter of less than 14.1kiloparsecs. Radial velocity measurements reveal that the satellites in this structure have the same sense of rotation about their host. This shows conclusively that substantial numbers of dwarf satellite galaxies share the same dynamical orbital properties and direction of angular momentum. Intriguingly, the plane we identify is approximately aligned with the pole of the Milky Way's disk and with the vector between the Milky Way and Andromeda.

AB  - We compute black hole masses and bolometric luminosities for 57 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the redshift range 1.25 <= z <= 2.67, selected from the GOODS-South deep multi-wavelength survey field via their X-ray emission. We determine host galaxy morphological parameters by separating the galaxies from their central point sources in deep Hubble Space Telescope images, and host stellar masses and colors by multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution fitting. Of GOODS AGNs at these redshifts, 90% have detected rest-frame optical nuclear point sources; bolometric luminosities range from 2 × 1043 to 2 × 1046 erg s-1. The black holes are growing at a range of accretion rates, with >~ 50% of the sample having L/L Edd < 0.1. Of the host galaxies, 70% have stellar masses M * > 1010 M &sun;, with a range of colors suggesting a complex star formation history. We find no evolution of AGN bolometric luminosity within the sample, and no correlation between AGN bolometric luminosity and host stellar mass, color, or morphology. Fully half the sample of host galaxies are disk-dominated, with another 25% having strong disk components. Fewer than 15% of the systems appear to be at some stage of a major merger. These moderate-luminosity AGN hosts are therefore inconsistent with a dynamical history dominated by mergers strong enough to destroy disks, indicating that minor mergers or secular processes dominate the coevolution of galaxies and their central black holes at z ~ 2.

AB  - The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H 0) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter LambdaCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 $\pm$ 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, ∑m nu < 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34+0.86 -0.88 (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H 0. The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H 0, without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = -1.10 $\pm$ 0.14 (68% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Yp = 0.326 $\pm$ 0.075 (68% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature-E-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21sigma, compared with 13sigma from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature-B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38% to Delta alpha =-1.1$\pm$ 1.4$\,^\circ$ statistical $\pm$ 1.5 systematic (68% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration.  WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.

AB  - WMAP precision data enable accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat Lambda-dominated universe seeded by a nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. For the WMAP data only, the best-fit parameters are h=0.72+/-0.05, Omegabh2=0.024+/-0.001, Omegamh2=0.14+/-0.02, tau=0.166+0.076-0.071, ns=0.99+/-0.04, and sigma8=0.9+/-0.1. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and measurements of large-scale structure (galaxy surveys and the Lyalpha forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements: its inferred age of the universe is consistent with stellar ages, the baryon/photon ratio is consistent with measurements of the [D/H] ratio, and the inferred Hubble constant is consistent with local observations of the expansion rate. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements, and Lyalpha forest data to find the model's best-fit cosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, Omegabh2=0.0224+/-0.0009, Omegamh2=0.135+0.008-0.009, tau=0.17+/-0.06, ns(0.05 Mpc-1)=0.93+/-0.03, and sigma8=0.84+/-0.04. WMAP's best determination of tau=0.17+/-0.04 arises directly from the temperature-polarization (TE) data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+/-0.2 Gyr. With the Lyalpha forest data, the model favors but does not require a slowly varying spectral index. The significance of this running index is sensitive to the uncertainties in the Lyalpha forest.  By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data, we constrain the geometry of the universe, Omegatot=1.02+/-0.02, and the equation of state of the dark energy, w<-0.78 (95% confidence limit assuming w>=-1). The combination of WMAP and 2dFGRS data constrains the energy density in stable neutrinos: Omeganuh2<0.0072 (95% confidence limit). For three degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 eV (95% confidence limit). The WMAP detection of early reionization rules out warm dark matter.  WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.

AB  - We develop stochastic variational inference, a scalable algorithm for approximating posterior distributions. We develop this technique for a large class of probabilistic models and we demonstrate it with two probabilistic topic models, latent Dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical Dirichlet process topic model. Using stochastic variational inference, we analyze several large collections of documents: 300K articles from Nature, 1.8M articles from The New York Times, and 3.8M articles from Wikipedia. Stochastic inference can handle the full data, and outperforms traditional variational inference on a subset. (Further, we show that the Bayesian nonparametric topic model outperforms its parametric counterpart.) Stochastic variational inference lets us apply complex Bayesian models to very large data sets.

AB  - It has recently been demonstrated that one can accurately derive galaxy morphology from particular primary and secondary isophotal shape estimates in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging catalog. This was accomplished by applying Machine Learning techniques to the Galaxy Zoo morphology catalog. Using the broad bandpass photometry of the SDSS in combination with precise knowledge of galaxy morphology should help in estimating more accurate photometric redshifts for galaxies. Using the Galaxy Zoo separation for spirals and ellipticals in combination with SDSS photometry we attempt to calculate photometric redshifts. In the best case we find that the root-mean-square error for luminous red galaxies classified as ellipticals is as low as 0.0118. Given these promising results we believe better photometric redshift estimates for all galaxies in the SDSS (~350 million) will be feasible if researchers can also leverage their derived morphologies via Machine Learning. These initial results look to be promising for those interested in estimating weak lensing, baryonic acoustic oscillation, and other fields dependent upon accurate photometric redshifts.

AB  - Some active galactic nuclei (AGN) are surrounded by extended emission-line regions (EELRs), which trace both the illumination pattern of escaping radiation and its history over the light travel time from the AGN to the gas. From a new set of such EELRs, we present evidence that the AGN in many Seyfert galaxies undergo luminous episodes 0.2-2 ? years in duration. Motivated by the discovery of the spectacular nebula known as Hanny's Voorwerp, ionized by a powerful AGN which has apparently faded dramatically within ? years, Galaxy Zoo volunteers have carried out both targeted and serendipitous searches for similar emission-line clouds around low-redshift galaxies. We present the resulting list of candidates and describe spectroscopy identifying 19 galaxies with AGN-ionized regions at projected radii ? kpc. This search recovered known EELRs (such as Mrk 78, Mrk 266 and NGC 5252) and identified additional previously unknown cases, one with detected emission to ? kpc. One new Sy 2 was identified. At least 14/19 are in interacting or merging systems, suggesting that tidal tails are a prime source of distant gas out of the galaxy plane to be ionized by an AGN. We see a mix of one- and two-sided structures, with observed cone angles from 23? to 112?. We consider the energy balance in the ionized clouds, with lower and upper bounds on ionizing luminosity from recombination and ionization-parameter arguments, and estimate the luminosity of the core from the far-infrared data. The implied ratio of ionizing radiation seen by the clouds to that emitted by the nucleus, on the assumption of a non-variable nuclear source, ranges from 0.02 to ?; 7/19 exceed unity. Small values fit well with a heavily obscured AGN in which only a small fraction of the ionizing output escapes to be traced by surrounding gas. However, large values may require that the AGN has faded over tens of thousands of years, giving us several examples of systems in which such dramatic long-period variation has occurred; this is the only current technique for addressing these time-scales in AGN history. The relative numbers of faded and non-faded objects we infer, and the projected extents of the ionized regions, give our estimate (0.2-2 ? years) for the length of individual bright phases.

AB  - We present a study of local post-starburst galaxies (PSGs) using the photometric and spectroscopic observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the results from the Galaxy Zoo project. We find that the majority of our local PSG population have neither early- nor late-type morphologies but occupy a well-defined space within the colour-stellar mass diagram, most notably, the low-mass end of the 'green valley' below the transition mass thought to be the mass division between low-mass star-forming galaxies and high-mass passively evolving bulge-dominated galaxies. Our analysis suggests that it is likely that local PSGs will quickly transform into 'red', low-mass early-type galaxies as the stellar morphologies of the 'green' PSGs largely resemble that of the early-type galaxies within the same mass range. We propose that the current population of PSGs represents a population of galaxies which is rapidly transitioning between the star-forming and the passively evolving phases. Subsequently, these PSGs will contribute towards the build-up of the low-mass end of the 'red sequence' once the current population of young stars fade and stars are no longer being formed. These results are consistent with the idea of 'downsizing' where the build-up of smaller galaxies occurs at later epochs. This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 250 000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. Their contributions are individually acknowledged at .

We derive integrated magnitudes and u-r colours for the host and ring components and show continuum-subtracted Halpha+[N II] images for seven objects. We present a basic morphological and environmental analysis of the galaxies and discuss their properties in comparison with other types of early-type galaxies.

AB  - We present morphological classifications obtained using machine learning for objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR6 that have been classified by Galaxy Zoo into three classes, namely early types, spirals and point sources/artefacts. An artificial neural network is trained on a subset of objects classified by the human eye, and we test whether the machine-learning algorithm can reproduce the human classifications for the rest of the sample. We find that the success of the neural network in matching the human classifications depends crucially on the set of input parameters chosen for the machine-learning algorithm. The colours and parameters associated with profile fitting are reasonable in separating the objects into three classes. However, these results are considerably improved when adding adaptive shape parameters as well as concentration and texture. The adaptive moments, concentration and texture parameters alone cannot distinguish between early type galaxies and the point sources/artefacts. Using a set of 12 parameters, the neural network is able to reproduce the human classifications to better than 90 per cent for all three morphological classes. We find that using a training set that is incomplete in magnitude does not degrade our results given our particular choice of the input parameters to the network. We conclude that it is promising to use machine-learning algorithms to perform morphological classification for the next generation of wide-field imaging surveys and that the Galaxy Zoo catalogue provides an invaluable training set for such purposes.

AB  - We report on the finding of a correlation between the past star formation activity of galaxies and the degree to which the rotation axes of neighbouring galaxies are aligned. This is obtained by cross-correlating star formation histories, derived using the multiple optimized parameter estimation and data compression (MOPED) algorithm, and the spatial coherence of spin direction (chirality), as determined by the Galaxy Zoo project, for a sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies. Our findings suggest that spiral galaxies, which formed the majority of their stars early (z > 2), tend to display coherent rotation over scales of ~10Mpch-1. The correlation is weaker for galaxies with significant recent star formation. We find evidence for this alignment at more than the 5sigma level, but no correlation with other galaxy stellar properties. This finding can be explained within the context of hierarchical tidal-torque theory if the SDSS galaxies harbouring the majority of the old stellar population were formed in the past, in the same filament and at about the same time. Galaxies with significant recent star formation instead are in the field, thus influenced by the general tidal field that will align them in random directions, or have had a recent merger that would promote star formation but change the spin direction.

AB  - We investigate the effect of dust on spiral galaxies by measuring the inclination dependence of optical colours for 24276 well-resolved Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies visually classified via the Galaxy Zoo project. We find clear trends of reddening with inclination which imply a total extinction from face-on to edge-on of 0.7, 0.6, 0.5 and 0.4mag for the ugri passbands (estimating 0.3mag of extinction in z band). We split the sample into discy' (late-type) spirals using the SDSS fracdeV (or fDeV) parameter and show that the average face-on colour of discy' spirals. This shows that the observed optical colour of a spiral galaxy is determined almost equally by the spiral type (via the bulge-disc ratio and stellar populations), and reddening due to dust. We find that both luminosity and spiral type affect the total amount of extinction, with discy spirals at Mr ~ -21.5mag having the most reddening - more than twice as much as both the lowest luminosity and most massive, bulge-dominated spirals. An increase in dust content is well known for more luminous galaxies, but the decrease of the trend for the most luminous has not been observed before and may be related to their lower levels of recent star formation. We compare our results with the latest dust attenuation models of Tuffs et al. We find that the model reproduces the observed trends reasonably well but overpredicts the amount of u-band attenuation in edge-on galaxies. This could be an inadequacy in the Milky Way extinction law (when applied to external galaxies), but more likely indicates the need for a wider range of dust-star geometries. We end by discussing the effects of dust on large galaxy surveys and emphasize that these effects will become important as we push to higher precision measurements of galaxy properties and their clustering.

AB  - The Milky Way Project citizen science initiative recently increased the number of known infrared bubbles in the inner Galactic plane by an order of magnitude compared to previous studies. We present a detailed statistical analysis of this data set with the Red MSX Source (RMS) catalog of massive young stellar sources to investigate the association of these bubbles with massive star formation. We particularly address the question of massive triggered star formation near infrared bubbles. We find a strong positional correlation of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) and H II regions with Milky Way Project bubbles at separations of <2 bubble radii. As bubble sizes increase, a statistically significant overdensity of massive young sources emerges in the region of the bubble rims, possibly indicating the occurrence of triggered star formation. Based on numbers of bubble-associated RMS sources, we find that 67% $\pm$ 3% of MYSOs and (ultra-)compact H II regions appear to be associated with a bubble. We estimate that approximately 22% $\pm$ 2% of massive young stars may have formed as a result of feedback from expanding H II regions. Using MYSO-bubble correlations, we serendipitously recovered the location of the recently discovered massive cluster Mercer 81, suggesting the potential of such analyses for discovery of heavily extincted distant clusters.

AB  - We present a new catalogue of 5106 infrared bubbles created through visual classification via the online citizen science website 'The Milky Way Project'. Bubbles in the new catalogue have been independently measured by at least five individuals, producing consensus parameters for their position, radius, thickness, eccentricity and position angle. Citizen scientists - volunteers recruited online and taking part in this research - have independently rediscovered the locations of at least 86 per cent of three widely used catalogues of bubbles and H II regions whilst finding an order of magnitude more objects. 29 per cent of the Milky Way Project catalogue bubbles lie on the rim of a larger bubble, or have smaller bubbles located within them, opening up the possibility of better statistical studies of triggered star formation. Also outlined is the creation of a 'heat map' of star formation activity in the Galactic plane. This online resource provides a crowd-sourced map of bubbles and arcs in the Milky Way, and will enable better statistical analysis of Galactic star formation sites.

These 'hacks' are examples of the ways in which such tools can be used either alone, in on conjunction with online services. The result of a combination of multiple, online services to form a new facility is called a mash-up. Some of what follows falls into that definition. As we move into an era of online data and tools, it is the network as a whole that becomes important. Tools emerging from this network can be capable of more than the sum of their parts.

AB  - The distribution of dust in the ecliptic plane between 0.96 and 1.04 au has been inferred from impacts on the two Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft through observation of secondary particle trails and unexpected off-points in the heliospheric imager (HI) cameras. This study made use of analysis carried out by members of a distributed web-based citizen science project Solar Stormwatch. A comparison between observations of the brightest particle trails and a survey of fainter trails shows consistent distributions. While there is no obvious correlation between this distribution and the occurrence of individual meteor streams at Earth, there are some broad longitudinal features in these distributions that are also observed in sources of the sporadic meteor population. The different position of the HI instrument on the two STEREO spacecraft leads to each sampling different populations of dust particles. The asymmetry in the number of trails seen by each spacecraft and the fact that there are many more unexpected off-points in the HI-B than in HI-A indicates that the majority of impacts are coming from the apex direction. For impacts causing off-points in the HI-B camera, these dust particles are estimated to have masses in excess of 10-17 kg with radii exceeding 0.1 mum.  For off-points observed in the HI-A images, which can only have been caused by particles travelling from the anti-apex direction, the distribution is consistent with that of secondary 'storm' trails observed by HI-B, providing evidence that these trails also result from impacts with primary particles from an anti-apex source. Investigating the mass distribution for the off-points of both HI-A and HI-B, it is apparent that the differential mass index of particles from the apex direction (causing off-points in HI-B) is consistently above 2. This indicates that the majority of the mass is within the smaller particles of this population. In contrast, the differential mass index of particles from the anti-apex direction (causing off-points in HI-A) is consistently below 2, indicating that the majority of the mass is to be found in larger particles of this distribution. This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 14 000 volunteers in the Solar Stormwatch project ().

AB  - We present a two-dimensional (2D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT, ver. 3) with new capabilities to study the structural components of galaxies and other astronomical objects in digital images. Our technique improves on previous 2D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the Sérsic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the Sérsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity.

AB  - We present a two-dimensional fitting algorithm (GALFIT) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas: by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use two-dimensional models such as the Nuker'' law, the Sérsic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Some potential applications of our program include: standard modeling of global galaxy profiles; extracting bars, stellar disks, double nuclei, and compact nuclear sources; and measuring absolute dust extinction or surface brightness fluctuations after removing the galaxy model. When examined in detail, we find that even simple looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position angle twists can be modeled accurately in two dimensions. We illustrate this by way of 11 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare two-dimensional and one-dimensional extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

AB  - The OPERA neutrino experiment at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory has measured the velocity of neutrinos from the CERN CNGS beam over a baseline of about 730 km. The measurement is based on data taken by OPERA in the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Dedicated upgrades of the CNGS timing system and of the OPERA detector, as well as a high precision geodesy campaign for the measurement of the neutrino baseline, allowed reaching comparable systematic and statistical accuracies. An arrival time of CNGS muon neutrinos with respect to the one computed assuming the speed of light in vacuum of (6.5 +/- 7.4(stat.)((+8.3)(-8.0)sys.))ns was measured corresponding to a relative difference of the muon neutrino velocity with respect to the speed of light (v-c)/c =(2.7 +/-3.1(stat.)((+3.4)(-3.3)(sys.))x10^(-6). The above result, obtained by comparing the time distributions of neutrino interactions and of protons hitting the CNGS target in 10.5 microseconds long extractions, was confrmed by a test performed at the end of 2011 using a short bunch beam allowing to measure the neutrino time of flight at the single interaction level.

AB  - Accurate distances to celestial objects are key to establishing the age and energy density of the universe and the nature of dark energy. A distance measure using active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has been sought for more than 40 years, as they are extremely luminous and can be observed at very large distances. We report here the discovery of an accurate luminosity distance measure using AGNs. We use the tight relationship between the luminosity of an AGN and the radius of its broad-line region established via reverberation mapping to determine the luminosity distances to a sample of 38 AGNs. All reliable distance measures up to now have been limited to moderate redshift---AGNs will, for the first time, allow distances to be estimated to z ~ 4, where variations of dark energy and alternate gravity theories can be probed.

AB  - It is straightforward to determine the size of the Earth and the distance to the Moon without using a telescope. The methods have been known since the third century BCE. However, few astronomers have done this measurement from data they have taken. We use a gnomon to determine the latitude and longitude of South Bend, Indiana, and College Station, Texas, and determine the value of the radius of the Earth to be Rearth=6290 km, only 1.4% smaller than the known value. We use the method of Aristarchus and the size of the Earth's shadow during the lunar eclipse of June 15, 2011 to estimate the distance to the Moon to be 62.3Rearth, 3.3% greater than the known mean value. We use measurements of the angular motion of the Moon against the background stars over the course of two nights, using a simple cross staff device, to estimate the Moon's distance at perigee and apogee. We use simultaneous observations of asteroid 1996 HW1 obtained with small telescopes in Socorro, New Mexico, and Ojai, California, to obtain a value of the Astronomical Unit of (1.59+/-0.19)×108 km, about 6% too large. The data and methods presented here can easily become part of an introductory astronomy laboratory class.

AB  - We present redshift probability distributions for galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 imaging data. We used the nearest-neighbor weighting algorithm to derive the ensemble redshift distribution N(z), and individual redshift probability distributions P(z) for galaxies with r < 21.8 and u < 29.0. As part of this technique, we calculated weights for a set of training galaxies with known redshifts such that their density distribution in five-dimensional color-magnitude space was proportional to that of the photometry-only sample, producing a nearly fair sample in that space. We estimated the ensemble N(z) of the photometric sample by constructing a weighted histogram of the training-set redshifts. We derived P(z)'s for individual objects by using training-set objects from the local color-magnitude space around each photometric object. Using the P(z) for each galaxy can reduce the statistical error in measurements that depend on the redshifts of individual galaxies. The spectroscopic training sample is substantially larger than that used for the DR7 release. The newly added PRIMUS catalog is now the most important training set used in this analysis by a wide margin. We expect the primary sources of error in the N(z) reconstruction to be sample variance and spectroscopic failures: The training sets are drawn from relatively small volumes of space, and some samples have large incompleteness. Using simulations we estimated the uncertainty in N(z) due to sample variance at a given redshift to be ~10%-15%. The uncertainty on calculations incorporating N(z) or P(z) depends on how they are used; we discuss the case of weak lensing measurements. The P(z) catalog is publicly available from the SDSS Web site.

AB  - The influence of a galaxy's environment on its evolution has been studied and compared extensively in the literature, although differing techniques are often used to define environment. Most methods fall into two broad groups: those that use nearest neighbours to probe the underlying density field and those that use fixed apertures. The differences between the two inhibit a clean comparison between analyses and leave open the possibility that, even with the same data, different properties are actually being measured. In this work, we apply 20 published environment definitions to a common mock galaxy catalogue constrained to look like the local Universe. We find that nearest-neighbour-based measures best probe the internal densities of high-mass haloes, while at low masses the interhalo separation dominates and acts to smooth out local density variations. The resulting correlation also shows that nearest-neighbour galaxy environment is largely independent of dark matter halo mass. Conversely, aperture-based methods that probe superhalo scales accurately identify high-density regions corresponding to high-mass haloes. Both methods show how galaxies in dense environments tend to be redder, with the exception of the largest apertures, but these are the strongest at recovering the background dark matter environment. We also warn against using photometric redshifts to define environment in all but the densest regions. When considering environment, there are two regimes: the 'local environment' internal to a halo best measured with nearest neighbour and 'large-scale environment' external to a halo best measured with apertures. This leads to the conclusion that there is no universal environment measure and the most suitable method depends on the scale being probed.

AB  - We investigate the dependence of the occurrence of bars in galaxies on galaxy properties and environment. We use a volume-limited sample of 33,391 galaxies brighter than Mr = -19.5 + 5logh at 0.02 <= z <= 0.05489, drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. We classify the galaxies into early and late types, and identify bars by visual inspection. Among 10,674 late-type galaxies with axis ratio b/a > 0.60, we find 3240 barred galaxies (f bar = 30.4%) which divide into 2542 strong bars (f SB1 = 23.8%) and 698 weak bars (f SB2 = 6.5%). We find that f SB1 increases as u - r color becomes redder and that it has a maximum value at intermediate velocity dispersion (sigma sime150 km s-1). This trend suggests that strong bars are dominantly hosted by intermediate-mass systems. Weak bars prefer bluer galaxies with lower mass and lower concentration. In the case of strong bars, their dependence on the concentration index appears only for massive galaxies with sigma > 150 km s-1. We also find that f bar does not directly depend on the large-scale background density when other physical parameters (u - r color or sigma) are fixed. We discover that f SB1 decreases as the separation to the nearest neighbor galaxy becomes smaller than 0.1 times the virial radius of the neighbor regardless of neighbor's morphology. These results imply that strong bars are likely to be destroyed during strong tidal interactions and that the mechanism for this phenomenon is gravitational and not hydrodynamical. The fraction of weak bars has no correlation with environmental parameters. We do not find any direct evidence for environmental stimulation of bar formation.

AB  - We have mapped the key mid-IR diagnostics in eight major merger systems of the Toomre sequence (NGC 4676, NGC 7592, NGC 6621, NGC 2623, NGC 6240, NGC 520, NGC 3921, and NGC 7252) using the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph. With these maps, we explore the variation of the ionized-gas, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), and warm gas (H2) properties across the sequence and within the galaxies. While the global PAH interband strength and ionized gas flux ratios ([Ne III]/[Ne II]) are similar to those of normal star-forming galaxies, the distribution of the spatially resolved PAH and fine structure line flux ratios is significantly different from one system to the other. Rather than a constant H2/PAH flux ratio, we find that the relation between the H2 and PAH fluxes is characterized by a power law with a roughly constant exponent (0.61 $\pm$ 0.05) over all merger components and spatial scales. While following the same power law on local scales, three galaxies have a factor of 10 larger integrated (i.e., global) H2/PAH flux ratio than the rest of the sample, even larger than what it is in most nearby active galactic nuclei. These findings suggest a common dominant excitation mechanism for H2 emission over a large range of global H2/PAH flux ratios in major mergers. Early-merger systems show a different distribution between the cold (CO J = 1-0) and warm (H2) molecular gas components, which is likely due to the merger interaction. Strong evidence for buried star formation in the overlap region of the merging galaxies is found in two merger systems (NGC 6621 and NGC 7592) as seen in the PAH, [Ne II], [Ne III], and warm gas line emission, but with no apparent corresponding CO (J = 1-0) emission. The minimum of the 11.3/7.7 mum PAH interband strength ratio is typically located in the nuclei of galaxies, while the [Ne III/[Ne II] ratio increases with distance from the nucleus. Our findings also demonstrate that the variations of the physical conditions within a merger are much larger than any systematic trends along the Toomre sequence.

AB  - The properties of both observed galaxies and dark matter haloes in simulations depend on their environment. The term 'environment' has, however, been used to describe a wide variety of measures that may or may not correlate with each other. Popular measures of environment include, for example, the distance to the Nth nearest neighbour, the number density of objects within some distance or, for the case of galaxies only, the mass of the host dark matter halo. Here we use results from the Millennium Simulation and a semi-analytic model for galaxy formation to quantify the relations between different measures of environment and halo mass. We show that the environmental parameters used in the observational literature are in effect measures of halo mass, even if they are measured for a fixed stellar mass. The strongest correlation between environmental density and halo mass arises when the number of objects is counted out to a distance of 1.5-2 times the virial radius of the host halo and when the galaxies/haloes are required to be relatively bright/massive. For observational studies, this virial radius is not easily determined, but the number of neighbours out to 1-2 h-1 Mpc gives a similarly strong correlation with halo mass. For the distance to the Nth nearest neighbour, the (anti)correlation with halo mass is nearly as strong provided N>= 2. We demonstrate that this environmental parameter becomes insensitive to halo mass if it is constructed from dimensionless quantities. This can be achieved by scaling the minimum luminosity/mass of neighbours to that of the object that the environment is determined for and by dividing the distance to a length-scale associated with either the neighbour or the galaxy under consideration. We show how such a halo mass independent environmental parameter can be defined for both observational and numerical studies. The results presented here will help future studies to disentangle the effects of halo mass and external environment on the properties of galaxies and dark matter haloes.

AB  - To optimally identify candidates of the Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nuclei (AGN) that contribute to the unresolved X-ray background in infrared surveys, a tracer of column density is desirable in addition to an AGN indicator. In a recent study, we aimed to test whether the 9.7mum silicate absorption feature can be used for this purpose when seen at high optical depths. We found that the extreme criterion of optical thickness at 9.7mum is efficient in identifying CT objects among local AGN. Having identified six of the nine CT AGN in the 12mum sample with Spitzer and X-ray spectra, we expanded this analysis at intermediate/high z, using all GOODS and FLS sources with Spitzer and X-ray observations. We found 12 sources with taum >1 that host an AGN between 0.8<z<2.7. Four of them are likely to be CT according to their low X-ray to 6 mum luminosity ratio. Surveys with complete coverage in both mid-infrared spectra and X-ray data can provide large populations of such sources, as at least 5-9% of all infrared bright galaxies in the GOODS and FLS samples are taum >1 AGN.

AB  - We present an analysis of the environmental dependence of bars and bulges in disc galaxies, using a volume-limited catalogue of 15 810 galaxies at z < 0.06 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with visual morphologies from the Galaxy Zoo 2 project. We find that the likelihood of having a bar, or bulge, in disc galaxies increases when the galaxies have redder (optical) colours and larger stellar masses, and observe a transition in the bar and bulge likelihoods at M*= 2 × 1010 M&sun;, such that massive disc galaxies are more likely to host bars and bulges. In addition, while some barred and most bulge-dominated galaxies are on the `red sequence' of the colour-magnitude diagram, we see a wider variety of colours for galaxies that host bars. We use galaxy clustering methods to demonstrate statistically significant environmental correlations of barred, and bulge-dominated, galaxies, from projected separations of 150 kpc h-1 to 3 Mpc h-1. These environmental correlations appear to be independent of each other: i.e. bulge-dominated disc galaxies exhibit a significant bar-environment correlation, and barred disc galaxies show a bulge-environment correlation. As a result of sparse sampling tests - our sample is nearly 20 times larger than those used previously - we argue that previous studies that did not detect a bar-environment correlation were likely inhibited by small number statistics. We demonstrate that approximately half of the bar-environment correlation can be explained by the fact that more massive dark matter haloes host redder disc galaxies, which are then more likely to have bars; this fraction is estimated to be 50 $\pm$ 10 per cent from a mock catalogue analysis and 60 $\pm$ 5 per cent from the data. Likewise, we show that the environmental dependence of stellar mass can only explain a smaller fraction (25 $\pm$ 10 per cent) of the bar-environment correlation. Therefore, a significant fraction of our observed environmental dependence of barred galaxies is not due to colour or stellar mass dependences, and hence must be due to another galaxy property, such as gas content, or to environmental influences. Finally, by analysing the projected clustering of barred and unbarred disc galaxies with halo occupation models, we argue that barred galaxies are in slightly higher mass haloes than unbarred ones, and some of them (approximately 25 per cent) are satellite galaxies in groups. We discuss the implications of our results on the effects of minor mergers and interactions on bar formation in disc galaxies.

AB  - Using deep 100 and 160 mum observations in GOODS-South from GOODS-Herschel, combined with high-resolution HST/WFC3 near-infrared imaging from CANDELS, we present the first detailed morphological analysis of a complete, far-infrared (FIR) selected sample of 52 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs; L IR > 1012 L &sun;) at z ~ 2. We also make use of a comparison sample of galaxies with lower IR luminosities but with the same redshift and H-band magnitude distribution. Our visual classifications of these two samples indicate that the fractions of objects with disk and spheroid morphologies are roughly the same but that there are significantly more mergers, interactions, and irregular galaxies among the ULIRGs (72+5 - 7% versus 32 $\pm$ 3%). The combination of disk and irregular/interacting morphologies suggests that early-stage interactions, minor mergers, and disk instabilities could play an important role in ULIRGs at z ~ 2. We compare these fractions with those of a z ~ 1 sample selected from GOODS-H and COSMOS across a wide luminosity range and find that the fraction of disks decreases systematically with L IR while the fraction of mergers and interactions increases, as has been observed locally. At comparable luminosities, the fraction of ULIRGs with various morphological classifications is similar at z ~ 2 and z ~ 1, though there are slightly fewer mergers and slightly more disks at higher redshift. We investigate the position of the z ~ 2 ULIRGs, along with 70 z ~ 2 LIRGs, on the specific star formation rate versus redshift plane, and find 52 systems to be starbursts (i.e., they lie more than a factor of three above the main-sequence relation). We find that many of these systems are clear interactions and mergers (~50%) compared to only 24% of systems on the main sequence relation. If irregular disks are included as potential minor mergers, then we find that up to ~73% of starbursts are involved in a merger or interaction at some level. Although the final coalescence of a major merger may not be required for the high luminosities of ULIRGs at z ~ 2 as is the case locally, the large fraction (50%-73%) of interactions at all stages and potential minor mergers suggests that these processes contribute significantly to the high star formation rates of ULIRGs at z ~ 2. Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.

AB  - Ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with multiple (>=3) nuclei are frequently observed. It has been suggested that these nuclei are produced by multiple major mergers of galaxies. The expected rate of such mergers is, however, too low to reproduce the observed number of ULIRGs with multiple nuclei. We have performed high-resolution simulations of the merging of two gas-rich disk galaxies. We found that extremely massive and compact star clusters form from the strongly disturbed gas disks after the first or second encounter between the galaxies. The mass of such clusters reaches ~108 M &sun; and their half-mass radii are 20-30 pc. Since these clusters consist of young stars, they appear as several bright cores in the galactic central region (~kpc). The peak luminosity of these clusters reaches ~10% of the total luminosity of the merging galaxy. These massive and compact clusters are consistent with the characteristics of the observed multiple nuclei in ULIRGs. Multiple mergers are not necessary to explain multiple nuclei in ULIRGs.

AB  - Observations of 10 Compact Symmetric Object (CSO) candidates have been made with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 8.4 GHz in 2005 and with a combined Chinese and European Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) array at 8.4 GHz in 2009. The 2009 observations incorporate for the first time the two new Chinese telescopes at Miyun and Kunming for international astrophysical observations. The observational data, in combination with archival VLBA data from previous epochs, have been used to derive the proper motions of the VLBI components. Because of the long time baseline of ~16 years of the VLBI data sets, the expansion velocities of the hot spots can be measured at an accuracy as high as ~1.3 muas yr-1. Six of the ten sources are identified as CSOs with a typical double or triple morphology on the basis of both spectral index maps and their mirror symmetry of proper motions of the terminal hot spots. The compact double source J1324+4048 is also identified as a CSO candidate. Among the three remaining sources, J1756+5748 and J2312+3847 are identified as core-jet sources with proper motions of their jet components relating to systemic source expansion. The third source J0017+5312 is likely also a core-jet source, but a robust detection of a core is needed for an unambiguous identification. The kinematic ages of the CSOs derived from proper motions range from 300 to 2500 years. The kinematic age distribution of the CSOs confirm an overabundance of compact young CSOs with ages less than 500 years. CSOs with known kinematic ages may be used to study the dynamical evolution of extragalactic radio sources at early stages.

Our analysis reveals PAH features in only a minority (30%) of the objects with good IRS spectra. Using the wealth of complementary data available for the 2 Jy and 3CRR samples we make detailed comparisons between a range of star formation diagnostics: optical continuum spectroscopy, mid- to far-IR (MFIR) color, far-IR excess and PAH detection. There is good agreement between the various diagnostic techniques: most candidates identified to have star formation activity on the basis of PAH detection are also identified using at least two of the other techniques. We find that only 35% of the combined 2 Jy and 3CRR sample show evidence for recent star formation activity (RSFA) at optical and/or MFIR wavelengths. This result argues strongly against the idea of a close link between starburst and powerful radio-loud AGN activity, reinforcing the view that, although a large fraction of powerful radio galaxies may be triggered in galaxy interactions, only a minority are triggered at the peaks of star formation activity in major, gas-rich mergers. However, we find that compact radio sources (D < 15 kpc) show a significantly higher incidence of RSFA (>75%) than their more extended counterparts (≈15%-25%). We discuss this result in the context of a possible bias toward the selection of compact radio sources triggered in gas-rich environments.

AB  - Galaxy merging is a fundamental aspect of the standard hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm. Recently, the Galaxy Zoo project has compiled a large, homogeneous catalogue of 3373 mergers, through direct visual inspection of the entire Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic sample. We explore a subset of galaxies from this catalogue that are spheroidal 'post-mergers' (SPMs) - where a single remnant is in the final stages of relaxation after the merger and shows evidence for a dominant bulge, making them plausible progenitors of early-type galaxies. Our results indicate that the SPMs have bluer colours than the general early-type galaxy population possibly due to merger-induced star formation. An analysis using optical emission-line ratios indicates that 20 of our SPMs exhibit LINER or Seyfert-like activity (68 per cent), while the remaining 10 galaxies are classified as either star forming (16 per cent) or quiescent (16 per cent). A comparison to the emission-line activity in the ongoing mergers from Darg et al. indicates that the active galactic nuclei (AGN) fraction rises in the post-mergers, suggesting that the AGN phase probably becomes dominant only in the very final stages of the merger process. The optical colours of the SPMs and the plausible mass ratios for their progenitors indicate that, while a minority are consistent with major mergers between two early-type galaxies, the vast majority are remnants of major mergers where at least one progenitor is a late-type galaxy.

AB  - We determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) using an area of 143 deg2 from the first three years of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. The magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r < 19.4 mag over two-thirds and 19.8 mag over one-third of the area. The GSMF is determined from a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method. This efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number density versus redshift. With H0= 70 km s-1 Mpc-1, the GSMF is well described between 108 and 1011.5 M&sun; using a double Schechter function with ?, ?, alpha1=-0.35, ? and alpha2=-1.47. This result is more robust to uncertainties in the flow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower Sloan Digital Sky Survey main sample (r < 17.8 mag). The upturn in the GSMF is also seen directly in the i-band and K-band galaxy luminosity functions. Accurately measuring the GSMF below 108 M&sun; is possible within the GAMA survey volume but as expected requires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from low surface-brightness galaxies.

AB  - Different stellar sub-populations of the Milky Way's stellar disk are known to have different vertical scale heights, their thickness increasing with age. Using SEGUE spectroscopic survey data, we have recently shown that mono-abundance sub-populations, defined in the [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] space, are well described by single-exponential spatial-density profiles in both the radial and the vertical direction; therefore, any star of a given abundance is clearly associated with a sub-population of scale height hz . Here, we work out how to determine the stellar surface-mass density contributions at the solar radius R 0 of each such sub-population, accounting for the survey selection function, and for the fraction of the stellar population mass that is reflected in the spectroscopic target stars given populations of different abundances and their presumed age distributions. Taken together, this enables us to derive \Sigma _R_0(h_z), the surface-mass contributions of stellar populations with scale height hz . Surprisingly, we find no hint of a thin-thick disk bi-modality in this mass-weighted scale-height distribution, but a smoothly decreasing function, approximately \Sigma _R_0(h_z)\propto \exp (-h_z), from hz ≈ 200 pc to hz ≈ 1 kpc. As hz is ultimately the structurally defining property of a thin or thick disk, this shows clearly that the Milky Way has a continuous and monotonic distribution of disk thicknesses: there is no "thick disk" sensibly characterized as a distinct component. We discuss how our result is consistent with evidence for seeming bi-modality in purely geometric disk decompositions or chemical abundances analyses. We constrain the total visible stellar surface-mass density at the solar radius to be \Sigma ^^*_R_0 = 30 +/- 1\ M_\odot pc-2.

AB  - Context. Observations of the gamma-ray sky with Fermi led to significant advances towards understanding blazars, the most extreme class of active galactic nuclei. A large fraction of the population detected by Fermi is formed by BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects, whose sample has always suffered from a severe redshift incompleteness due to the quasi-featureless optical spectra. Aims: Our goal is to provide a significant increase of the number of confirmed high-redshift BL Lac objects contained in the 2 LAC Fermi/LAT cataloge. Methods: For 103 Fermi/LAT blazars, photometric redshifts using spectral energy distribution fitting have been obtained. The photometry includes 13 broad-band filters from the far ultraviolet to the near-IR observed with Swift/UVOT and the multi-channel imager GROND at the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope. Data have been taken quasi-simultaneously and the remaining source-intrinsic variability has been corrected for. Results: We release the UV-to-near-IR 13-band photometry for all 103 sources and provide redshift constraints for 75 sources without previously known redshift. Out of those, eight have reliable photometric redshifts at z1.3, while for the other 67 sources we provide upper limits. Six of the former eight are BL Lac objects, which quadruples the sample of confirmed high-redshift BL Lac. This includes three sources with redshifts higher than the previous record for BL Lac, including CRATES J0402-2615, with the best-fit solution at z ≈ 1.9.

AB  - In order to understand environmental effects on star formation in high-redshift galaxies, we investigate the physical relationships between the star formation activity, stellar mass, and environment for z ~= 1.2 galaxies in the 2 deg2 COSMOS field. We estimate star formation using the [O II]lambda3727 emission line and environment from the local galaxy density. Our analysis shows that for massive galaxies (M changed_arxiv py.py scpt.scpt >~ 1010 M &sun;), the fraction of [O II] emitters in high-density environments (Sigma10th >~ 3.9 Mpc-2) is 1.7 $\pm$ 0.4 times higher than in low-density environments (Sigma10th <~ 1.5 Mpc-2), while the [O II] emitter fraction does not depend on environment for low-mass M changed_arxiv py.py scpt.scpt <~ 1010 M &sun; galaxies. In order to understand what drives these trends, we investigate the role of companion galaxies in our sample. We find that the fraction of [O II] emitters in galaxies with companions is 2.4 $\pm$ 0.5 times as high as that in galaxies without companions at M changed_arxiv py.py scpt.scpt >~ 1010 M &sun;. In addition, massive galaxies are more likely to have companions in high-density environments. However, although the number of star-forming galaxies increases for massive galaxies with close companions and in dense environments, the average star formation rate of star-forming galaxies at a given mass is independent of environment and the presence/absence of a close companion. These results suggest that interactions and/or mergers in a high-density environment could induce star formation in massive galaxies at z ~ 1.2, increasing the fraction of star-forming galaxies with M changed_arxiv py.py scpt.scpt >~ 1010 M &sun;.

AB  - Most galaxy evolutionary models require quasar feedback to regulate star formation in their host galaxies. In particular, at high redshift, models expect that feedback associated with quasar-driven outflows is so efficient that the gas in the host galaxy is largely swept away or heated up, hence suppressing star formation in massive galaxies. We observationally investigate this phenomenon by using VLT-SINFONI integral field spectroscopy of the luminous quasar 2QZJ002830.4-281706 at z = 2.4. The spectra sample the optical emission lines redshifted into the near-IR. The [OIII]lambda5007 emission-line kinematics map reveals a massive outflow on scales of several kpc. The detection of narrow Halpha emission reveals star formation in the quasar host galaxy, with SFR ~ 100 M&sun; yr-1. However, the star formation is not distributed uniformly, but is strongly suppressed in the region with the highest outflow velocity and highest velocity dispersion. This result indicates that star formation in this region is strongly quenched by the quasar outflow, which is cleaning the galaxy disk of its molecular gas. This is one of the first direct observational proofs of quasar feedback quenching the star formation at high redshift. Based on data obtained at the VLT through the ESO program 077.B-0218(A).Appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org

AB  - We present results of an analysis of the local (z ~ 0) morphology-environment relation for 911 bright (MB < -19) galaxies, based on matching classical RC3 morphologies with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey based group catalog of Yang et al., which includes halo mass estimates. This allows us to study how the relative fractions of spirals, lenticulars, and ellipticals depend on halo mass over a range of 1011.7-1014.8 h -1 M &sun;, from isolated single-galaxy halos to massive groups and low-mass clusters. We pay particular attention to how morphology relates to central versus satellite status (where "central" galaxies are the most massive within their halo). The fraction of galaxies which are elliptical is a strong function of stellar mass; it is also a strong function of halo mass, but only for central galaxies. We interpret this as evidence for a scenario where elliptical galaxies are always formed, probably via mergers, as central galaxies within their halos, with satellite ellipticals being previously central galaxies accreted onto a larger halo. The overall fraction of galaxies which are S0 increases strongly with halo mass, from ~10% to ~70%. Here, too, we find striking differences between the central and satellite populations. 20% $\pm$ 2% of central galaxies with stellar masses M changed_arxiv py.py scpt.scpt > 1010.5 M &sun; are S0 regardless of halo mass, but satellite S0 galaxies are only found in massive (>1013 h -1 M &sun;) halos, where they are 69% $\pm$ 4% of the M changed_arxiv py.py scpt.scpt > 1010.5 M &sun; satellite population. This suggests two channels for forming S0 galaxies: one which operates for central galaxies and another which transforms lower-mass ( M changed_arxiv py.py scpt.scpt <~ 1011 M &sun;) accreted spirals into satellite S0 galaxies in massive halos. Analysis of finer morphological structure (bars and rings in disk galaxies) shows some trends with stellar mass, but none with halo mass; this is consistent with other recent studies which indicate that bars are not strongly influenced by galaxy environment. Radio sources in high-mass central galaxies are common, similarly so for elliptical and S0 galaxies, with a frequency that increases with the halo mass. Emission-line active galactic nuclei (mostly LINERs) are more common in S0s, but show no strong trends with environment.

AB  - We present optical to far-infrared photometry of 31 reddened QSOs that show evidence for radiatively driven outflows originating from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in their rest-frame UV spectra. We use these data to study the relationships between the AGN-driven outflows, and the AGN and starburst infrared luminosities. We find that FeLoBAL QSOs are invariably IR-luminous, with IR luminosities exceeding 1012 L &sun; in all cases. The AGN supplies 76% of the total IR emission, on average, but with a range from 20% to 100%. We find no evidence that the absolute luminosity of obscured star formation is affected by the AGN-driven outflows. Conversely, we find an anticorrelation between the strength of AGN-driven outflows, as measured from the range of outflow velocities over which absorption exceeds a minimal threshold, and the contribution from star formation to the total IR luminosity, with a much higher chance of seeing a starburst contribution in excess of 25% in systems with weak outflows than in systems with strong outflows. Moreover, we find no convincing evidence that this effect is driven by the IR luminosity of the AGN. We conclude that radiatively driven outflows from AGNs can have a dramatic, negative impact on luminous star formation in their host galaxies. We find that such outflows act to curtail star formation such that star formation contributes less than ~25% of the total IR luminosity. We also propose that the degree to which termination of star formation takes place is not deducible from the IR luminosity of the AGN.

It features efficient source detection and handling methods, noise suppression via smoothing or multi-resolution wavelet reconstruction, and a range of graphical and text-based outputs to allow the user to understand the detections. This paper details some of the key algorithms used and illustrates the effectiveness of the finder on different data sets.

AB  - We report deep Green Bank Telescope spectroscopy in the redshifted H I 21 cm and OH 18 cm lines from the z = 0.765 absorption system toward PMN J0134-0931. A comparison between the "satellite" OH 18 cm line redshifts, or between the redshifts of the H I 21 cm and "main" OH 18 cm lines, is sensitive to changes in different combinations of three fundamental constants, the fine structure constant alpha, the proton-electron mass ratio mu ≡ mp /me , and the proton g-factor gp . We find that the satellite OH 18 cm lines are not perfectly conjugate, with both different line shapes and stronger 1612 MHz absorption than 1720 MHz emission. This implies that the satellite lines of this absorber are not suitable to probe fundamental constant evolution. A comparison between the redshifts of the H I 21 cm and OH 18 cm lines, via a multi-Gaussian fit, yields the strong constraint [DeltaF/F] = [ - 5.2 $\pm$ 4.3] × 10-6, where F ≡ gp [mualpha2]1.57 and the error budget includes contributions from both statistical and systematic errors. We thus find no evidence for a change in the constants between z = 0.765 and the present epoch. Incorporating the constraint [Deltamu/mu] < 3.6 × 10-7 from another absorber at a similar redshift and assuming that fractional changes in gp are much smaller than those in alpha, we obtain [Deltaalpha/alpha] = (- 1.7 $\pm$ 1.4) × 10-6 over a look-back time of 6.7 Gyr.

AB  - The large size of the ASKAP Hi surveys DINGO and WALLABY necessitates automated 3D source finding. A performance difference of a few percent corresponds to a significant number of galaxies being detected or undetected. As such, the performance of the automated source finding is of paramount importance to both of these surveys. We have analysed the performance of various source finders to determine which will allow us to meet our survey goals during the DINGO and WALLABY design studies. Here we present a comparison of the performance of five different methods of automated source finding. These source finders are duchamp, gamma-finder, a cnhi finder, a 2d-1d wavelet reconstruction finder and a sigma clipping method (s+c finder). Each source finder was applied to the same three-dimensional data cubes containing (a) point sources with a Gaussian velocity profile and (b) spatially extended model-galaxies with inclinations and rotation profiles. We focus on the completeness and reliability of each algorithm when comparing the performance of the different source finders.

AB  - We present the results from new ~15 ks Chandra-ACIS and 4.9 GHz Very Large Array (VLA) observations of 13 galaxies hosting low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This completes the multiwavelength study of a sample of 51 nearby early-type galaxies described in Capetti & Balmaverde and Balmaverde & Capetti. The aim of the three previous papers was to explore the connection between the host galaxies and AGN activity in a radio-selected sample. We detect nuclear X-ray emission in eight sources and radio emission in all but one (viz., UGC 6985). The new VLA observations improve the spatial resolution by a factor of 10: the presence of nuclear radio sources in 12 of the 13 galaxies confirms their AGN nature. As previously indicated, the behavior of the X-ray and radio emission in these sources depends strongly on the form of their optical surface brightness profiles derived from Hubble Space Telescope imaging, i.e., on their classification as "core," "power-law," or "intermediate" galaxies. With more than twice the number of "power-law" and "intermediate" galaxies compared to previous work, we confirm with a much higher statistical significance that these galaxies lie well above the radio-X-ray correlation established in Fanaroff-Riley type I radio galaxies and the low-luminosity "core" galaxies. This result highlights the fact that the "radio-loud/radio-quiet" dichotomy is a function of the host galaxy's optical surface brightness profile. We present radio-optical-X-ray spectral indices for all 51 sample galaxies. Survival statistics point to significant differences in the radio-to-optical and radio-to-X-ray spectral indices between the "core" and "power-law" galaxies (Gehan's Generalized Wilcoxon test probability p for the two classes being statistically similar is <10-5), but not in the optical-to-X-ray spectral indices (p = 0.25). Therefore, the primary difference between the "core" and "power-law" galaxies is in their ability to launch powerful radio outflows. This result is consistent with the hypothesis of different formation processes and evolution histories in "core" and "power-law" galaxies: major mergers are likely to have created "core" galaxies, while minor mergers were instrumental in the creation of "power-law" galaxies.

AB  - We study a sample of 61submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) selected from ground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed with the Herschel Space Observatory as part of the PACS Evolutionary Probe (PEP) and the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) guaranteed time key programmes. Our study makes use of the broad far-infrared and submillimetre wavelength coverage (100-600 mum) only made possible by the combination of observations from the PACS and SPIRE instruments aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. Using a power-law temperature distribution model to derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dust emissivity spectral index for SMGs of beta = 2.0 $\pm$ 0.2. Our results unambiguously unveil the diversity of the SMG population. Some SMGs exhibit extreme infrared luminosities of s1013L&sun; and relatively warm dust components, while others are fainter (a few times 1012 L&sun;) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. Although at zs2 classical SMGs (>5 mJy at 850 mum) have large infrared luminosities (s1013 L&sun;), objects only selected on their submm flux densities (without any redshift informations) probe a large range in dust temperatures and infrared luminosities. The extreme infrared luminosities of some SMGs (LIR ≳ 1012.7 L&sun;, 26/61 systems) imply star formation rates (SFRs) of >500 M&sun; yr-1 (assuming a Chabrier IMF and no dominant AGN contribution to the FIR luminosity). Such high SFRs are difficult to reconcile with a secular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-driven stage in the evolution of these galaxies. Another observational argument in favour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than that of SMGs of lower luminosities (s40 K as opposed to s25 K), consistent with observations of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies triggered by major mergers and with results from hydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfer calculations. Moreover, we find that luminous SMGs are systematically offset from normal star-forming galaxies in the stellar mass-SFR plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburst events with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. On the other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity SMGs have cold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of star formation, and therefore might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation. However, the properties of this latter population, especially their dust temperature, should be treated with caution because at these luminosities SMGs are not a representative sample of the entire star-forming galaxy population.

AB  - We present the results of a series of numerical simulations aimed to study the evolution of a disc galaxy within the global tidal field of a group environment. Both the disc galaxy and the group are modelled as multicomponent, collisionless, N-body systems, composed of both dark matter and stars. In our simulations, the evolution of disc galaxies is followed after they are released from the group virial radius, and as their orbits sink towards the group centre, under the effect of dynamical friction. We explore a broad parameter space, covering several aspects of the galaxy-group interaction that are potentially relevant to galaxy evolution. Namely, prograde and retrograde orbits, orbital eccentricities, disc inclination, role of a central bulge in discs, internal disc kinematics and galaxy-to-group mass ratios. We find that significant disc transformations occur only after the mean density of the group, measured within the orbit of the galaxy, exceeds ˜0.3-1 times the central mean density of the galaxy. The morphological evolution of discs is found to be strongly dependent on the initial inclination of the disc with respect to its orbital plane, i.e. discs on face-on and retrograde orbits are shown to retain their disc structures and kinematics longer, in comparison to prograde discs. This suggests that after interacting with the global tidal field alone, a significant fraction of disc galaxies should be found in the central regions of groups. Prominent central bulges are not produced, and pre-existing bulges are not enhanced in discs after the interaction with the group. Assuming that most S0 are formed in group environments, this implies that prominent bulges should be formed mostly by young stars, created only after a galaxy has been accreted by a group. Finally, contrary to some current implementations of tidal stripping in semi-analytical models of galaxy evolution, we find that more massive galaxies suffer more tidal stripping. This is because dynamical friction brings them faster to the group centre, in comparison to their lower mass counterparts.

AB  - The inevitable spread in properties of the toroidal obscuration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) invalidates the widespread notion that type 1 and 2 AGNs are intrinsically the same objects, drawn randomly from the distribution of torus covering factors. Instead, AGNs are drawn preferentially from the distribution; type 2 are more likely drawn from the distribution higher end, type 1 from its lower end. Type 2 AGNs have a higher IR luminosity, lower narrow-line luminosity, and a higher fraction of Compton thick X-ray obscuration than type 1. Meaningful studies of unification statistics cannot be conducted without first determining the intrinsic distribution function of torus covering factors.

AB  - We investigate the buildup of galaxies at z ~ 1 using maps of Halpha and stellar continuum emission for a sample of 57 galaxies with rest-frame Halpha equivalent widths >100 Å in the 3D-HST grism survey. We find that the Halpha emission broadly follows the rest-frame R-band light but that it is typically somewhat more extended and clumpy. We quantify the spatial distribution with the half-light radius. The median Halpha effective radius re (Halpha) is 4.2 $\pm$ 0.1 kpc but the sizes span a large range, from compact objects with re (Halpha) ~ 1.0 kpc to extended disks with re (Halpha) ~ 15 kpc. Comparing Halpha sizes to continuum sizes, we find <re (Halpha)/re (R) > =1.3 $\pm$ 0.1 for the full sample. That is, star formation, as traced by Halpha, typically occurs out to larger radii than the rest-frame R-band stellar continuum; galaxies are growing their radii and building up from the inside out. This effect appears to be somewhat more pronounced for the largest galaxies. Using the measured Halpha sizes, we derive star formation rate surface densities, SigmaSFR. We find that SigmaSFR ranges from ~0.05 M &sun; yr-1 kpc-2 for the largest galaxies to ~5 M &sun; yr-1 kpc-2 for the smallest galaxies, implying a large range in physical conditions in rapidly star-forming z ~ 1 galaxies. Finally, we infer that all galaxies in the sample have very high gas mass fractions and stellar mass doubling times <500 Myr. Although other explanations are also possible, a straightforward interpretation is that we are simultaneously witnessing the rapid formation of compact bulges and large disks at z ~ 1.

AB  - We study the quasi-simultaneous near-IR, optical, ultraviolet and X-ray photometry of 11 gamma-ray selected blazars for which redshift estimates larger than 1.2 have been recently provided. Four of these objects turn out to be high-power blazars with the peak of their synchrotron emission between ˜3 × 1015 and ˜1016 Hz, and therefore of a kind predicted to exist but never seen before. This discovery has important implications for our understanding of physical processes in blazars, including the so-called 'blazar sequence', and might also help in constraining the extragalactic background light through gamma-ray absorption since two sources are strongly detected even in the 10-100 GeV Fermi-LAT band. Based on our previous work and their high powers, these sources are very likely high-redshift flat-spectrum radio quasars, with their emission lines swamped by the non-thermal continuum.

AB  - The contributions of everyday individuals to significant research has grown dramatically beyond the early days of classical birdwatching and endeavors of amateurs of the 19th century. Now people who are casually interested in science can participate directly in research covering diverse scientific fields. Regarding astronomy, volunteers, either as individuals or as networks of people, are involved in a variety of types of studies. Citizen Science is intuitive, engaging, yet necessarily robust in its adoption of scientific principles and methods. Herein, we discuss Citizen Science, focusing on fully participatory projects such as Zooniverse (by several of the authors CL, AS, LF, SB), with mention of other programs. In particular, we make the case that citizen science (CS) can be an important aspect of the scientific data analysis pipelines provided to scientists by observatories.

AB  - We selected a sample of 437 BL Lac objects, taken from the RomaBZCat catalogue, for which spectroscopic information and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry are available. We propose a new classification of BL Lacs in which the sources' type is not defined only on the basis of the peak frequency of the synchrotron component in their spectral energy distribution (types L and H), but also on the relevance of this component with respect to the brightness of the host galaxy (types N and G, for nucleus- or galaxy-dominated sources). We found that the SDSS colour index u-r = 1.4 is a good separator between these two types. We used multiband colour-colour plots to study the properties of the BL Lac classes and found that in the X-ray to radio flux ratio versus u-r plot most of the N (blue) sources are located in a rather narrow strip, while the G (red) sources are spread in a large area, and most of them are located in galaxy clusters or interacting systems, suggesting that their X-ray emission is not from a genuine BL Lac nucleus but it is related to their environment. Of the about 135 sources detected in the gamma rays by Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, nearly all belong to the N-type, indicating that only this type of sources should be considered as genuine BL Lac nuclei. The J-H, H-K plot of sources detected in the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) catalogue is consistent with that of the 'bona fide' BL Lac objects, independently of their N or G classification from the optical indices, indicating the existence in G-type sources of a K-band excess possibly due to a steep, low frequency peaked emission which deserves further investigations. We propose to use these colour plots as a further tool for searching candidate counterparts of newly discovered high-energy sources.

AB  - We have discovered a 2.5 Mpc (projected) long filament of infrared-bright galaxies connecting two of the three ~5 × 1014 M &sun; clusters making up the RCS 2319+00 supercluster at z = 0.9. The filament is revealed in a deep Herschel Spectral and Photometric Imaging REceiver (SPIRE) map that shows 250-500 mum emission associated with a spectroscopically identified filament of galaxies spanning two X-ray bright cluster cores. We estimate that the total (8-1000 mum) infrared luminosity of the filament is L IR ~= 5 × 1012 L &sun;, which, if due to star formation alone, corresponds to a total SFR ~= 900 M &sun; yr-1. We are witnessing the scene of the buildup of a >1015 M &sun; cluster of galaxies, seen prior to the merging of three massive components, each of which already contains a population of red, passive galaxies that formed at z > 2. The infrared filament demonstrates that significant stellar mass assembly is taking place in the moderate density, dynamically active circumcluster environments of the most massive clusters at high redshift, and this activity is concomitant with the hierarchical buildup of large-scale structure.

AB  - We report the discovery of an interesting and rare rectangular-shaped galaxy. At a distance of 21 Mpc, the dwarf galaxy LEDA 074886 has an absolute R-band magnitude of -17.3 mag. Adding to this galaxy's intrigue is the presence of an embedded, edge-on stellar disk (of extent 2 R e, disk = 12'' = 1.2 kpc) for which Forbes et al. reported v rot/sigma ≈ 1.4. We speculate that this galaxy may be the remnant of two (nearly edge-on) merged disk galaxies in which the initial gas was driven inward and subsequently formed the inner disk, while the stars at larger radii effectively experienced a dissipationless merger event resulting in this "emerald cut galaxy" having very boxy isophotes with a 4/a = -0.05 to -0.08 from 3 to 5 kpc. This galaxy suggests that knowledge from simulations of both "wet" and "dry" galaxy mergers may need to be combined to properly understand the various paths that galaxy evolution can take, with a particular relevance to blue elliptical galaxies.

AB  - We have developed the ''S IX'' statistic to identify bright, highly likely active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates solely on the basis of Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS), and ROSAT all-sky survey (RASS) data. This statistic was optimized with data from the preliminary WISE survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and tested with Lick 3 m Kast spectroscopy. We find that sources with S IX < 0 have a gsim95% likelihood of being an AGN (defined in this paper as a Seyfert 1, quasar, or blazar). This statistic was then applied to the full WISE/2MASS/RASS dataset, including the final WISE data release, to yield the ''W2R'' sample of 4316 sources with S IX < 0. Only 2209 of these sources are currently in the Veron-Cetty and Veron (VCV) catalog of spectroscopically confirmed AGNs, indicating that the W2R sample contains nearly 2000 new, relatively bright (J <~ 16) AGNs. We utilize the W2R sample to quantify biases and incompleteness in the VCV catalog. We find that it is highly complete for bright (J < 14), northern AGNs, but the completeness drops below 50% for fainter, southern samples and for sources near the Galactic plane. This approach also led to the spectroscopic identification of 10 new AGNs in the Kepler field, more than doubling the number of AGNs being monitored by Kepler. The W2R sample contains better than 1 bright AGN every 10 deg2, permitting construction of AGN samples in any sufficiently large region of sky.

AB  - We examine the absorption of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons by formaldehyde (H2CO) over cosmic time. The K-doublet rotational transitions of H2CO become "refrigerated"---their excitation temperatures are driven below the CMB temperature---via collisional pumping by molecular hydrogen (H2). "Anti-inverted" H2CO line ratios thus provide an accurate measurement of the H2 density in molecular clouds. Using a radiative transfer model, we demonstrate that H2CO centimeter wavelength line excitation and detectability are nearly independent of redshift or gas kinetic temperature. Since the H2CO K-doublet lines absorb CMB light, and since the CMB lies behind every galaxy and provides an exceptionally uniform extended illumination source, H2CO is a distance-independent, extinction-free molecular gas mass-limited tracer of dense gas in galaxies. A Formaldehyde Deep Field could map the history of cosmic star formation in a uniquely unbiased fashion and may be possible with large bandwidth wide-field radio interferometers whereby the silhouettes of star-forming galaxies would be detected across the epoch of galaxy evolution. We also examine the possibility that H2CO lines may provide a standardizable galaxy ruler for cosmology similar to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in galaxy clusters but applicable to much higher redshifts and larger samples. Finally, we explore how anti-inverted meter-wave H2CO lines in galaxies during the peak of cosmic star formation may contaminate H I 21 cm tomography of the Epoch of Reionization.

AB  - While automatic detection of point sources in astronomical images has experienced a great degree of success, less effort has been directed towards the detection of extended and low-surface-brightness features. At present, existing telescopes still rely on human expertise to reduce the raw data to usable images and then to analyse the images for non-pointlike objects. However, the next generation of radio telescopes will generate unprecedented volumes of data making manual data reduction and object extraction infeasible. Without developing new methods of automatic detection for extended and diffuse objects such as supernova remnants, bent-tailed galaxies, radio relics and halos, a wealth of scientifically important results will not be uncovered. In this paper we explore the response of the Circle Hough Transform to a representative sample of different extended circular or arc-like astronomical objects. We also examine the response of the Circle Hough Transform to input images containing noise alone and inputs including point sources.

AB  - Whether or not a correlation exists between the radio and gamma-ray flux densities of blazars is a long-standing question, and one that is difficult to answer confidently because of various observational biases, which may either dilute or apparently enhance any intrinsic correlation between radio and gamma-ray luminosities. We introduce a novel method of data randomization to evaluate quantitatively the effect of these biases and to assess the intrinsic significance of an apparent correlation between radio and gamma-ray flux densities of blazars. The novelty of the method lies in a combination of data randomization in luminosity space (to ensure that the randomized data are intrinsically, and not just apparently, uncorrelated) and significance assessment in flux space (to explicitly avoid Malmquist bias and automatically account for the limited dynamical range in both frequencies). The method is applicable even to small samples that are not selected with strict statistical criteria. For larger samples we describe a variation of the method in which the sample is split in redshift bins, and the randomization is applied in each bin individually; this variation is designed to yield the equivalent to luminosity-function sampling of the underlying population in the limit of very large, statistically complete samples. We show that for a smaller number of redshift bins, the method yields a worse significance, and in this way it is conservative: although it may fail to confirm an existing intrinsic correlation in a small sample that cannot be split into many redshift bins, it will not assign a stronger, artificially enhanced significance. We demonstrate how our test performs as a function of number of sources, strength of correlation, and number of redshift bins used, and we show that while our test is robust against common-distance biases and associated false positives for uncorrelated data, it retains the power of other methods in rejecting the null hypothesis of no correlation for correlated data.

AB  - The recent implementation of radiative transfer algorithms in numerous hydrodynamics codes has led to a dramatic improvement in studies of feedback in various astrophysical environments. However, because of methodological limitations and computational expense, the spectra of radiation sources are generally sampled at only a few evenly spaced discrete emission frequencies. Using one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations, we investigate the discrepancies in gas properties surrounding model stars and accreting black holes that arise solely due to spectral discretization. We find that even in the idealized case of a static and uniform density field, commonly used discretization schemes induce errors in the neutral fraction and temperature by factors of two to three on average, and by over an order of magnitude in certain column density regimes. The consequences are most severe for radiative feedback operating on large scales, dense clumps of gas, and media consisting of multiple chemical species. We have developed a method for optimally constructing discrete spectra, and show that for two test cases of interest, carefully chosen four-bin spectra can eliminate errors associated with frequency resolution to high precision. Applying these findings to a fully three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulation of the early universe, we find that the H II region around a primordial star is substantially altered in both size and morphology, corroborating the one-dimensional prediction that discrete spectral energy distributions can lead to sizable inaccuracies in the physical properties of a medium, and as a result, the subsequent evolution and observable signatures of objects embedded within it.

AB  - We describe the infrared properties of sources detected over ~36 deg2 of sky in the GAMA 15 hr equatorial field, using data from both the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large-Area Survey (H-ATLAS) and Wide-field Infrared Survey (WISE). With 5sigma point-source depths of 34 and 0.048 mJy at 250 mum and 3.4 mum, respectively, we are able to identify 50.6% of the H-ATLAS sources in the WISE survey, corresponding to a surface density of ~630 deg-2. Approximately two-thirds of these sources have measured spectroscopic or optical/near-IR photometric redshifts of z < 1. For sources with spectroscopic redshifts at z < 0.3, we find a linear correlation between the infrared luminosity at 3.4 mum and that at 250 mum, with $\pm$50% scatter over ~1.5 orders of magnitude in luminosity, ~109-1010.5 L &sun;. By contrast, the matched sources without previously measured redshifts (r >~ 20.5) have 250-350 mum flux density ratios which suggest either high-redshift galaxies (z >~ 1.5) or optically faint low-redshift galaxies with unusually low temperatures (T <~ 20). Their small 3.4-250 mum flux ratios favor a high-redshift galaxy population, as only the most actively star-forming galaxies at low redshift (e.g., Arp 220) exhibit comparable flux density ratios. Furthermore, we find a relatively large active galactic nucleus fraction (~30%) in a 12 mum flux-limited subsample of H-ATLAS sources, also consistent with there being a significant population of high-redshift sources in the no-redshift sample.

AB  - Radiation, winds, and jets from the active nucleus of a massive galaxy can interact with its interstellar medium, and this can lead to ejection or heating of the gas. This terminates star formation in the galaxy and stifles accretion onto the black hole. Such active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can account for the observed proportionality between the central black hole and the host galaxy mass. Direct observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback, which occurs when AGN are very luminous, has been difficult to obtain but is accumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio mode, which uses the mechanical energy of radio-emitting jets often seen when AGN are operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical galaxies. This mode is well observed directly through X-ray observations of the central galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot surrounding medium. The energy flow, which is roughly continuous, heats the hot intracluster gas and reduces radiative cooling and subsequent star formation by an order of magnitude. Feedback appears to maintain a long-lived heating/cooling balance. Powerful, jetted radio outbursts may represent a further mode of energy feedback that affects the cores of groups and subclusters. New telescopes and instruments from the radio to X-ray bands will come into operation over the next several years and lead to a rapid expansion in observational data on all modes of AGN feedback.

AB  - We present a series of new high-sensitivity and high-resolution radio-continuum images of M31 at lambda=20 cm (nu=1.4 GHz). These new images were produced by merging archived 20 cm radio-continuum observations from the Very Large Array (VLA) telescope. Images presented here are sensitive to rms=60 muJy and feature high angular resolution (<10 arcsec). A complete sample of discrete radio sources have been catalogued and analysed across 17 individual VLA projects. We identified a total of 864 unique discrete radio sources across the field of M31. One of the most prominent regions in M31 is the ring feature for which we estimated total integrated flux of 706 mJy at lambda=20 cm. We compare here detected sources to those listed in Gelfand et al. (2004) at lambda=92 cm and find 118 sources in common to both surveys. The majority (61%) of these sources exhibit a spectral index of alpha <-0.6 indicating that their emission is predominantly non-thermal in nature, that is more typical for background objects.

AB  - Many blazars detected by the Fermi satellite, observed spectroscopically in the optical, are line-less, and have been classified as BL Lac objects. Optical-ultraviolet (UV) photometry of nearly 100 of them allowed us to determine the redshift for a handful of objects and redshift upper limits in the great majority. A few of these are candidates to be 'blue quasars', namely flat spectrum radio quasars whose broad emission lines are hidden by an overwhelming synchrotron emission peaking in the UV. This implies that the emitting electrons have high energies. In turn, this requires relatively weak radiative cooling, a condition that can be met if the main radiative dissipation of the jet power occurs outside the broad-line region. We confirm this hypothesis by studying and modelling the spectral energy distributions of the four 'blue quasars' recently discovered. Furthermore, we discuss the distribution of Fermi blazars in the gamma-ray spectral index-gamma-ray luminosity plane, and argue that 'blue quasars' objects are a minority within the blazar populations.

AB  - The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is an extremely capable and efficient black hole finder. We present a simple mid-infrared color criterion, W1 - W2 >= 0.8 (i.e., [3.4]-[4.6] >=0.8, Vega), which identifies 61.9 $\pm$ 5.4 active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates per deg2 to a depth of W2 ~ 15.0. This implies a much larger census of luminous AGNs than found by typical wide-area surveys, attributable to the fact that mid-infrared selection identifies both unobscured (type 1) and obscured (type 2) AGNs. Optical and soft X-ray surveys alone are highly biased toward only unobscured AGNs, while this simple WISE selection likely identifies even heavily obscured, Compton-thick AGNs. Using deep, public data in the COSMOS field, we explore the properties of WISE-selected AGN candidates. At the mid-infrared depth considered, 160 muJy at 4.6 mum, this simple criterion identifies 78% of Spitzer mid-infrared AGN candidates according to the criteria of Stern et al. and the reliability is 95%. We explore the demographics, multiwavelength properties and redshift distribution of WISE-selected AGN candidates in the COSMOS field.

AB  - Luminous extragalactic masers are traditionally referred to as the `megamasers'. Those produced by water molecules are associated with accretion disks, radio jets, or outflows in the nuclear regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The majority of OH maser sources are instead driven by intense star formation in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, although in a few cases the OH maser emission traces rotating (toroidal or disk) structures around the nuclear engines of AGN. Thus, detailed maser studies provide a fundamental contribution to our knowledge of the main nuclear components of AGN, constitute unique tools to measure geometric distances of host galaxies, and have a great impact on probing the, so far, paradigmatic Unified Model of AGN.

AB  - The Green Bank Telescope has been used to search for 21 cm H I emission over a large area between the galaxies M31 and M33 in an attempt to confirm at 9farcm1 angular resolution the detection by Braun & Thilker of a very extensive neutral gas "bridge" between the two systems at the level N H I ≈ 1017 cm-2. We detect H I emission at several locations up to 120 kpc in projected distance from M31, at least half the distance to M33, with velocities similar to that of the galaxies, confirming the essence of the Braun & Thilker discovery. The H I does not appear to be associated with the extraplanar high-velocity clouds of either galaxy. In two places we measure N H I > 3 × 1018 cm-2, indicative of concentrations of H I with ~105 M &sun; on scales <~ 2 kpc, but over most of the field we have only 5sigma upper limits of N H I <= 1.4 × 1018 cm-2. In very deep measurements in two directions H I lines were detected at a few 1017 cm-2. The absence of emission at another location to a 5sigma limit N H I <= 1.5 × 1017 cm-2 suggests that the H I bridge is either patchy or confined to within ~125 kpc of M31. The measurements also cover two of M31's dwarf galaxies, And II and And XV, but in neither case is there evidence for associated H I at the 5sigma level of 1.4 × 104 M &sun; for And II and 9.3 × 103 M &sun; for And XV.

AB  - We study the observed correlation between atomic gas content and the likelihood of hosting a large-scale bar in a sample of 2090 disc galaxies. Such a test has never been done before on this scale. We use data on morphologies from the Galaxy Zoo project and information on the galaxies' H I content from the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFALFA) blind H I survey. Our main result is that the bar fraction is significantly lower among gas-rich disc galaxies than gas-poor ones. This is not explained by known trends for more massive (stellar) and redder disc galaxies to host more bars and have lower gas fractions: we still see at fixed stellar mass a residual correlation between gas content and bar fraction. We discuss three possible causal explanations: (1) bars in disc galaxies cause atomic gas to be used up more quickly, (2) increasing the atomic gas content in a disc galaxy inhibits bar formation and (3) bar fraction and gas content are both driven by correlation with environmental effects (e.g. tidal triggering of bars, combined with strangulation removing gas). All three explanations are consistent with the observed correlations. In addition our observations suggest bars may reduce or halt star formation in the outer parts of discs by holding back the infall of external gas beyond bar co-rotation, reddening the global colours of barred disc galaxies. This suggests that secular evolution driven by the exchange of angular momentum between stars in the bar, and gas in the disc, acts as a feedback mechanism to regulate star formation in intermediate-mass disc galaxies. This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 200 000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project.

AB  - Radio galaxies and quasars are among the largest and most powerful single objects known and are believed to have had a significant impact on the evolving Universe and its large-scale structure. We explore the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the population of Fanaroff-Riley type II (FR II) objects, i.e. their kinetic luminosities, lifetimes and the central densities of their environments. In particular, the radio and kinetic luminosity functions of these powerful radio sources are investigated using the complete, flux-limited radio catalogues of the Third Cambridge Revised Revised Catalogue (3CRR) and Best et al. We construct multidimensional Monte Carlo simulations using semi-analytical models of FR II source time evolution to create artificial samples of radio galaxies. Unlike previous studies, we compare radio luminosity functions found with both the observed and simulated data to explore the best-fitting fundamental source parameters. The new Monte Carlo method we present here allows us to (i) set better limits on the predicted fundamental parameters of which confidence intervals estimated over broad ranges are presented and (ii) generate the most plausible underlying parent populations of these radio sources. Moreover, as has not been done before, we allow the source physical properties (kinetic luminosities, lifetimes and central densities) to co-evolve with redshift, and we find that all the investigated parameters most likely undergo cosmological evolution. Strikingly, we find that the break in the kinetic luminosity function must undergo redshift evolution of at least (1 + z)3. The fundamental parameters are strongly degenerate, and independent constraints are necessary to draw more precise conclusions. We use the estimated kinetic luminosity functions to set constraints on the duty cycles of these powerful radio sources. A comparison of the duty cycles of powerful FR IIs with those determined from radiative luminosities of active galactic nuclei of comparable black hole mass suggests a transition in behaviour from high to low redshifts, corresponding to either a drop in the typical black hole mass of powerful FR IIs at low redshifts, or a transition to a kinetically dominated, radiatively inefficient FR II population.

AB  - We present the results from a search of data from the first 33.5 days of the Kepler science mission (Quarter 1) for exoplanet transits by the Planet Hunters citizen science project. Planet Hunters enlists members of the general public to visually identify transits in the publicly released Kepler light curves via the World Wide Web. Over 24,000 volunteers reviewed the Kepler Quarter 1 data set. We examine the abundance of >=2 R ⊕ planets on short-period (<15 days) orbits based on Planet Hunters detections. We present these results along with an analysis of the detection efficiency of human classifiers to identify planetary transits including a comparison to the Kepler inventory of planet candidates. Although performance drops rapidly for smaller radii, >=4 R ⊕ Planet Hunters >=85% efficient at identifying transit signals for planets with periods less than 15 days for the Kepler sample of target stars. Our high efficiency rate for simulated transits along with recovery of the majority of Kepler >=4 R ⊕ planets suggests that the Kepler inventory of >=4 R ⊕ short-period planets is nearly complete.

AB  - We used GALEX ultraviolet and WISE 22 mum observations to investigate the current star formation activity of the optically red spirals recently identified as part of the Galaxy Zoo project. These galaxies were accurately selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as pure discs with low or no current star formation activity, representing one of the best optically selected samples of candidate passive spirals. However, we show that these galaxies are not only still forming stars at a significant rate (≳1 M&sun; yr-1) but, more importantly, their star formation activity is not different from that of normal star-forming discs of the same stellar mass (M* ≳ 1010.2 M&sun;). Indeed, these systems lie on the UV-optical blue sequence, even without any corrections for internal dust attenuation, and they follow the same specific star formation rate vs. stellar mass relation of star-forming galaxies. Our findings clearly show that at high stellar masses, optical colours do not allow to distinguish between actively star-forming and truly quiescent systems.

AB  - We present the first proper-motion (PM) measurements for the galaxy M31. We obtained new V-band imaging data with the Hubble Space Telescope ACS/WFC and the WFC3/UVIS instruments of three fields: a spheroid field near the minor axis, an outer disk field along the major axis, and a field on the Giant Southern Stream. The data provide five to seven year time baselines with respect to pre-existing deep first-epoch observations of the same fields. We measure the positions of thousands of M31 stars and hundreds of compact background galaxies in each field. High accuracy and robustness is achieved by building and fitting a unique template for each individual object. The average PM for each field is obtained from the average motion of the M31 stars between the epochs with respect to the background galaxies. For the three fields, the observed PMs (mu W , mu N ) are, in units of mas yr-1, (- 0.0458, -0.0376) $\pm$ (0.0165, 0.0154), (- 0.0533, -0.0104) $\pm$ (0.0246, 0.0244), and (- 0.0179, -0.0357) $\pm$ (0.0278, 0.0272), respectively. The ability to average over large numbers of objects and over the three fields yields a final displacement accuracy of a few thousandths of a pixel, corresponding to only 12 muas yr-1. This is comparable to what has been achieved for other Local Group galaxies using Very Long Baseline Array observations of water masers. Potential systematic errors are controlled by an analysis strategy that corrects for detector charge transfer inefficiency, spatially and time-dependent geometric distortion, and point-spread function variations. The robustness of the PM measurements and uncertainties are supported by the fact that data from different instruments, taken at different times and with different telescope orientations, as well as measurements of different fields, all yield statistically consistent results. Papers II and III of this series explore the implications of the new measurements for our understanding of the history, future, and mass of the Local Group.

AB  - We determine the velocity vector of M31 with respect to the Milky Way and use this to constrain the mass of the Local Group, based on Hubble Space Telescope proper-motion measurements of three fields presented in Paper I. We construct N-body models for M31 to correct the measurements for the contributions from stellar motions internal to M31. This yields an unbiased estimate for the M31 center-of-mass motion. We also estimate the center-of-mass motion independently, using the kinematics of satellite galaxies of M31 and the Local Group, following previous work but with an expanded satellite sample. All estimates are mutually consistent, and imply a weighted average M31 heliocentric transverse velocity of (vW , vN ) = (- 125.2 $\pm$ 30.8, -73.8 $\pm$ 28.4) km s-1. We correct for the reflex motion of the Sun using the most recent insights into the solar motion within the Milky Way, which imply a larger azimuthal velocity than previously believed. This implies a radial velocity of M31 with respect to the Milky Way of V rad, M31 = -109.3 $\pm$ 4.4 km s-1, and a tangential velocity of V tan, M31 = 17.0 km s-1, with a 1sigma confidence region of V tan, M31 <= 34.3 km s-1. Hence, the velocity vector of M31 is statistically consistent with a radial (head-on collision) orbit toward the Milky Way. We revise prior estimates for the Local Group timing mass, including corrections for cosmic bias and scatter, and obtain M LG ≡ M MW, vir + M M31, vir = (4.93 $\pm$ 1.63) × 1012 M &sun;. Summing known estimates for the individual masses of M31 and the Milky Way obtained from other dynamical methods yields smaller uncertainties. Bayesian combination of the different estimates demonstrates that the timing argument has too much (cosmic) scatter to help much in reducing uncertainties on the Local Group mass, but its inclusion does tend to increase other estimates by ~10%. We derive a final estimate for the Local Group mass from literature and new considerations of M LG = (3.17 $\pm$ 0.57) × 1012 M &sun;. The velocity and mass results at 95% confidence imply that M33 is bound to M31, consistent with expectation from observed tidal deformations.

AB  - We study the future orbital evolution and merging of the Milky Way (MW)-M31-M33 system, using a combination of collisionless N-body simulations and semi-analytic orbit integrations. Monte Carlo simulations are used to explore the consequences of varying all relevant initial phase-space and mass parameters within their observational uncertainties. The observed M31 transverse velocity from Papers I and II implies that the MW and M31 will merge t = 5.86+1.61 -0.72 Gyr from now. The first pericenter occurs at t = 3.87+0.42 -0.32 Gyr, at a pericenter distance of r = 31.0+38.0 -19.8 kpc. In 41% of Monte Carlo orbits, M31 makes a direct hit with the MW, defined here as a first-pericenter distance less than 25 kpc. For the M31-M33 system, the first-pericenter time and distance are t = 0.85+0.18 -0.13 Gyr and r = 80.8+42.2 -31.7 kpc. By the time M31 gets to its first pericenter with the MW, M33 is close to its second pericenter with M31. For the MW-M33 system, the first-pericenter time and distance are t = 3.70+0.74 -0.46 Gyr and r = 176.0+239.0 -136.9 kpc. The most likely outcome is for the MW and M31 to merge first, with M33 settling onto an orbit around them that may decay toward a merger later. However, there is a 9% probability that M33 makes a direct hit with the MW at its first pericenter, before M31 gets to or collides with the MW. Also, there is a 7% probability that M33 gets ejected from the Local Group, temporarily or permanently. The radial mass profile of the MW-M31 merger remnant is significantly more extended than the original profiles of either the MW or M31, and suggests that the merger remnant will resemble an elliptical galaxy. The Sun will most likely (~85% probability) end up at a larger radius from the center of the MW-M31 merger remnant than its current distance from the MW center, possibly further than 50 kpc (~10% probability). There is a ~20% probability that the Sun will at some time in the next 10 Gyr find itself moving through M33 (within 10 kpc), but while dynamically still bound to the MW-M31 merger remnant. The arrival and possible collision of M31 (and possibly M33) with the MW is the next major cosmic event affecting the environment of our Sun and solar system that can be predicted with some certainty.

AB  - Context. To understand the feedback of black holes on their environment or the acceleration of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the present cosmic epoch, a comprehensive inventory of radio galaxies in the local universe is needed. This requires an all-sky catalog of radio-emitting galaxies, that hitherto has not been available. Aims: We present such an all-sky sample. Our catalog allows one to build volume-limited subsamples containing all low-power radio galaxies, similar to the prototypical low-power radio galaxies Cen A or M 87, within some hundred Mpc. Methods: We match radio emission from the NVSS and SUMSS surveys to galaxies of the 2MASS redshift survey (2MRS) using an image-level algorithm that properly treats the extended structure of radio sources. Results: The bright master sample we present contains 575 radio-emitting galaxies with a flux greater than 213 mJy at 1.4 GHz. Over 30% of the galaxies in our catalog are not contained in existing large-area extra-galactic radio samples. We compute the optical and radio luminosity functions and the fraction of radio galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity. 94% of the radio galaxies within z = 0.03 are of Hubble type E/S0. The local galaxy density in a sphere of 2 Mpc centered on the radio galaxies is 1.7 times higher than around non-radio galaxies of the same luminosity and morphology, which is a statistically significant enhancement (>3sigma). Conclusions: Our sample presents the deepest all-sky catalog of low-power radio galaxies. The observed enhancement of the galaxy density around radio galaxies suggests a causal relation between external galaxy properties, such as environment or merger history, and the formation of powerful jets in the present universe. Since the enhancement is observed with respect to galaxies of the same luminosity and Hubble type, it is not primarily driven by black hole mass. Our automated matching procedure is found to select radio-emitting galaxies with high efficiency (99%) and purity (91%), which is key for future processing of deeper, larger samples. The master catalog (described in Table 1) and the catalog listing all radio matches per galaxy are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/544/A18 or at http://ragolu.science.ru.nl

AB  - We present the results from a Chandra pilot study of 12 massive galaxy mergers selected from Galaxy Zoo. The sample includes major mergers down to a host galaxy mass of 1011 M &sun; that already have optical active galactic nucleus (AGN) signatures in at least one of the progenitors. We find that the coincidences of optically selected active nuclei with mildly obscured (N H <~ 1.1 × 1022 cm-2) X-ray nuclei are relatively common (8/12), but the detections are too faint (<40 counts per nucleus; f 2-10 keV <~ 1.2 × 10-13 erg s-1 cm-2) to reliably separate starburst and nuclear activity as the origin of the X-ray emission. Only one merger is found to have confirmed binary X-ray nuclei, though the X-ray emission from its southern nucleus could be due solely to star formation. Thus, the occurrences of binary AGNs in these mergers are rare (0%-8%), unless most merger-induced active nuclei are very heavily obscured or Compton thick.

AB  - A shock-accelerated particle flux ∝p-s, where p is the particle momentum, follows from simple theoretical considerations of cosmic-ray acceleration at nonrelativistic shocks followed by rigidity-dependent escape into the Galactic halo. A flux of shock-accelerated cosmic-ray protons with s≈2.8 provides an adequate fit to the Fermi Large Area Telescope gamma-ray emission spectra of high-latitude and molecular cloud gas when uncertainties in nuclear production models are considered. A break in the spectrum of cosmic-ray protons claimed by Neronov, Semikoz, and Taylor [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 051105 (2012)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.108.051105] when fitting the gamma-ray spectra of high-latitude molecular clouds is a consequence of using a cosmic-ray proton flux described by a power law in kinetic energy.

AB  - We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging and spectroscopy, along with supporting Galaxy Evolution Explorer and ground-based data, for the extended high-ionization cloud known as Hanny's Voorwerp, near the spiral galaxy IC 2497. Wide Field Camera 3 images show complex dust absorption near the nucleus of IC 2497. The galaxy core in these data is, within the errors, coincident with the very long baseline interferometry core component marking the active nucleus. Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) optical spectra show the active galactic nucleus (AGN) to be a type 2 Seyfert galaxy of rather low luminosity. The derived ionization parameter log U = -3.5 is in accordance with the weak X-ray emission from the AGN. We find no high-ionization gas near the nucleus, adding to the evidence that the AGN is currently at a low radiative output (perhaps with the central black hole having switched to a mode dominated by kinetic energy). The nucleus is accompanied by an expanding ring of ionized gas ≈500 pc in projected diameter on the side opposite Hanny's Voorwerp. Where sampled by the STIS slit, this ring has Doppler offset ≈300 km s-1 from the nucleus, implying a kinematic age <7 × 105 years. Narrowband [O III] and Halpha+[N II] Advanced Camera for Surveys images show fine structure in Hanny's Voorwerp, including limb-brightened sections suggesting modest interaction with a galactic outflow and small areas where Halpha is strong. We identify these latter regions as regions ionized by recent star formation, in contrast to the AGN ionization of the entire cloud. These candidate "normal" H II regions contain blue continuum objects, whose colors are consistent with young stellar populations; they appear only in a 2 kpc region toward IC 2497 in projection, perhaps meaning that the star formation was triggered by compression from a narrow outflow. The ionization-sensitive ratio [O III]/Halpha shows broad bands across the object at a skew angle to the galaxy nucleus, and no discernible pattern near the prominent "hole" in the ionized gas. The independence of ionization and surface brightness (SB) suggests that there is substantial spatial structure which remains unresolved, to such an extent that the SB samples the number of denser filaments rather than the characteristic density in emission regions; this might be a typical feature of gas in tidal tails, currently measurable only when such gas is highly ionized. These results fit with our picture of an ionization echo from an AGN whose ionizing luminosity has dropped by a factor >100 (and possibly much more) within the last (1-2) × 105 years; we suggest a tentative sequence of events in IC 2497 and discuss implications of such rapid fluctuations in luminosity for our understanding of AGN demographics. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract No. NAS5-26555.

AB  - Recent deep Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 imaging suggests that a majority of compact quiescent massive galaxies at z ~ 2 may contain disks. To investigate this claim, we have compared the ellipticity distribution of 31 carefully selected high-redshift massive quiescent compact galaxies to a set of mass-selected ellipticity and Sérsic index distributions obtained from two-dimensional structural fits to ~40, 000 nearby galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that the distribution of ellipticities for the high-redshift galaxies is consistent with the ellipticity distribution of a similarly chosen sample of massive early-type galaxies. However, the distribution of Sérsic indices for the high-redshift sample is inconsistent with that of local early-type galaxies, and instead resembles that of local disk-dominated populations. The mismatch between the properties of high-redshift compact galaxies and those of both local early-type and disk-dominated systems leads us to conclude that the basic structures of high-redshift compact galaxies probably do not closely resemble those of any single local galaxy population. Any galaxy population analog to the high-redshift compact galaxies that exists at the current epoch is either a mix of different types of galaxies, or possibly a unique class of objects on their own.

AB  - We explore the nature of heavily obscured quasar host galaxies at z˜ 2 using deep Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3/infrared imaging of 28 dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) to investigate the role of major mergers in driving black hole growth. The high levels of obscuration of the quasars selected for this study act as a natural coronagraph, blocking the quasar light and allowing a clear view of the underlying host galaxy. The sample of heavily obscured quasars represents a significant fraction of the cosmic mass accretion on supermassive black holes as the quasars have inferred bolometric luminosities around the break of the quasar luminosity function. We find that only a small fraction (4 per cent, at most 11-25 per cent) of the quasar host galaxies are major mergers. Fits to their surface brightness profiles indicate that 90 per cent of the host galaxies are either disc dominated, or have a significant disc. This disc-like host morphology, and the corresponding weakness of bulges, is evidence against major mergers and suggests that secular processes are the predominant driver of massive black hole growth. Finally, we suggest that the coincidence of mergers and active galactic nucleus activity is luminosity dependent, with only the most luminous quasars being triggered mostly by major mergers. a MUSYC catalogue ID, see Cardamone et al. (2010). Objects with X-ray detections are marked with *. b See images shown in Fig. 1. c The ratio of the host luminosity to the point source luminosity, reported only when GALFIT requires an unresolved object to yield a physical fit. This may be due to an AGN point source (in the case of the X-ray-detected DOGs) or an unresolved bulge or central concentration, i.e. a central bulge. d See Fig. 2.

AB  - This paper examines star formation (SF) in relatively massive, primarily early-type galaxies (ETGs) at z ~ 0.1. A sample is drawn from bulge-dominated Galaxy Evolution Explorer/Sloan Digital Sky Survey (GALEX/SDSS) galaxies on the optical red sequence with strong UV excess and yet quiescent SDSS spectra. High-resolution far-UV imaging of 27 such ETGs using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys/Solar Blind Channel (ACS/SBC) reveals structured UV morphology in 93% of the sample, consistent with low-level ongoing SF (~0.5 M &sun; yr-1). In 3/4 of the sample the SF is extended on galaxy scales (25-75 kpc), while the rest contains smaller (5-15 kpc) SF patches in the vicinity of an ETG---presumably gas-rich satellites being disrupted. Optical imaging reveals that all ETGs with galaxy-scale SF in our sample have old stellar disks (mostly S0 type). None is classified as a true elliptical. In our sample, galaxy-scale SF takes the form of UV rings of varying sizes and morphologies. For the majority of such objects we conclude that the gas needed to fuel current SF has been accreted from the intergalactic medium, probably in a prolonged, quasi-static manner, leading in some cases to additional disk buildup. The remaining ETGs with galaxy-scale SF have UV and optical morphologies consistent with minor merger-driven SF or with the final stages of SF in fading spirals. Our analysis excludes that all recent SF on the red sequence resulted from gas-rich mergers. We find further evidence that galaxy-scale SF is almost exclusively an S0 phenomenon (~20% S0s have SF) by examining the overall optically red SDSS ETGs. Conclusion is that significant number of field S0s maintain or resume low-level SF because the preventive feedback is not in place or is intermittent. True ellipticals, on the other hand, stay entirely quiescent even in the field.

AB  - Observational studies have revealed a 'downsizing' trend in black hole (BH) growth: the number densities of luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) peak at higher redshifts than those of faint AGN. This would seem to imply that massive BHs formed before low-mass BHs, in apparent contradiction to hierarchical clustering scenarios. We investigate whether this observed 'downsizing' in BH growth is reproduced in a semi-analytic model for the formation and evolution of galaxies and BHs, set within the hierarchical paradigm for structure formation. In this model, BHs evolve from light seeds (˜100 M&sun;) and their growth is merger driven. The original Somerville et al. model (baseline model) reproduces the number density of AGN at intermediate redshifts and luminosities, but underproduces luminous AGN at very high redshift (z > 3) and overproduces them at low redshift (z < 1). In addition, the baseline model underproduces low-luminosity AGN at low redshift (z < 1). In order to solve these problems, we consider several modifications to the physical processes in the model: (1) a 'heavy' BH seeding scenario; (2) a sub-Eddington accretion rate ceiling that depends on the cold gas fraction and (3) an additional BH accretion mode due to disc instabilities. With these three modifications, the models can explain the observed downsizing, successfully reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity function and simultaneously reproduce galaxy and BH properties in the local Universe. We also perform a comparison with the observed soft and hard X-ray luminosity functions of AGN, including an empirical correction for torus-level obscuration, and reach similar conclusions. Our best-fitting model suggests a scenario in which disc instabilities are the main driver for moderately luminous Seyfert galaxies at low redshift, while major mergers are the main trigger for luminous AGN.

AB  - The distributions of galaxies in the environments of 16 large radio sources have been examined using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In the giant radio galaxy J1552+2005 (3C 326) which has the highest arm-length ratio, the shorter arm is found to interact with a group of galaxies which forms part of a filamentary structure. Although most large sources occur in regions of low galaxy density, the shorter arm is brighter in most cases suggesting asymmetries in the intergalactic medium which may not be apparent in the distribution of galaxies. In two cases with strong and variable cores, J0313+4120 and J1147+3501, the large flux density asymmetries are possibly also caused by the effects of relativistic motion.

AB  - The geometry of dust distribution within the inner regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still a debated issue and relates directly to the AGN unified scheme. Traditionally, models discussed in the literature assume one of the two distinct dust distributions in what is believed to be a toroidal region around the supermassive black holes: a continuous distribution, customarily referred to as smooth, and a concentration of dust in clumps or clouds, referred to as clumpy. In this paper we perform a thorough comparison between two of the most popular models in the literature, namely the smooth models by Fritz et al. and the clumpy models by Nenkova et al., in their common parameter space. Particular attention is paid to the silicate features at ˜9.7 and ˜18 mum, the width of the infrared bump, the near-infrared index and the luminosity at 12.3 mum, all previously reported as possible diagnostic tools to distinguish between the two dust distributions. We find that, due to different dust chemical compositions used in the two models, the behaviour of the silicate features at 9.7 and 18 mum is quite distinct between the two models. The width of the infrared bump and the peak of the infrared emission can take comparable values; their distributions do, however, vary. The near-infrared index is also quite different, due partly to the primary sources adopted by the two models. Models with matched parameters do not produce similar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and virtually no random parameter combinations can result in seemingly identical SEDs.

AB  - When the Sun ascends the red giant branch (RGB), its luminosity will increase and all the planets will receive much greater irradiation than they do now. Jupiter, in particular, might end up more highly irradiated than the hot Neptune GJ 436b and, hence, could appropriately be termed a "hot Jupiter." When their stars go through the RGB or asymptotic giant branch stages, many of the currently known Jupiter-mass planets in several-AU orbits will receive levels of irradiation comparable to the hot Jupiters, which will transiently increase their atmospheric temperatures to ~1000 K or more. Furthermore, massive planets around post-main-sequence stars could accrete a non-negligible amount of material from the enhanced stellar winds, thereby significantly altering their atmospheric chemistry as well as causing a significant accretion luminosity during the epochs of most intense stellar mass loss. Future generations of infrared observatories might be able to probe the thermal and chemical structure of such hot Jupiters' atmospheres. Finally, we argue that, unlike their main-sequence analogs (whose zonal winds are thought to be organized in only a few broad, planetary-scale jets), red-giant hot Jupiters should have multiple, narrow jets of zonal winds and efficient day-night redistribution.

AB  - We present deep Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph-South optical broad-band images for a complete sample of 20 Sloan Digital Sky Survey selected type II quasars taken from Zakamska et al., with redshifts in the range 0.3 < z < 0.41 and [O III]lambda5007 emission-line luminosities L[O iii ]>108.5 L<mrow></mrow>. The images were taken with the aim of investigating the interaction status of the quasar host galaxies, in order to determine the significance of galaxy interactions in triggering nuclear activity. We find that 15 of our sample of 20 (75 per cent) show evidence for interaction in the form of tails, shells, fans, irregular features, amorphous haloes and double nuclei. The median surface brightness of the features is <mover accent="true">mu˜r corr =23.4 mag arcsec-2 and the range is Deltamur corr ~=[20.9,24.7] mag arcsec-2. We find a similar rate of interaction signatures in the type II quasars as in a comparison sample of quiescent early-type galaxies at similar redshift (67 per cent) taken from Ramos Almeida et al. (RA11). However the surface brightness of the detected features is up to 2 mag brighter for the type II quasars than for the quiescent early types, which have surface brightnesses in the range Deltamur corr ~=[22.1,26.1] mag arcsec-2 and a median surface brightness <mover accent="true">mu˜r corr =24.3 mag arcsec-2. Despite the relatively small sample size, this may indicate that the mergers witnessed in the comparison sample galaxies could have different progenitors, or we may be viewing the interactions at different stages. We also compare our results with those of Ramos Almeida et al. (RA12) who made a similar analysis using a complete sample of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). They find a higher rate of interaction signatures in the radio-loud AGN (95 per cent) than the type II quasars, but a very similar range of surface brightnesses for the morphological features Deltamur corr ~=[20.9,24.8] mag arcsec-2, possibly indicating a similarity in the types of triggering interactions. The wide range of features detected in the type II quasar sample suggests that AGN activity can be triggered before, during or after the coalescence of the black holes, with six of the 20 objects (30 per cent) having double nuclei. Overall, the results presented here are consistent with the idea that galaxy interaction plays an important role in the triggering of quasar activity. We also use time-scale arguments to show that it is unlikely that most radio-quiet quasars cycle through a radio-loud phase as part of a single quasar triggering event.

AB  - We present the pilot results of the 'MAGMO' project, targeted observations of ground-state hydroxyl masers towards sites of 6.7-GHz methanol maser emission in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm tangent, Galactic longitudes 280$\,^\circ$ to 295$\,^\circ$. The 'MAGMO' project aims to determine if Galactic magnetic fields can be traced with Zeeman splitting of masers associated with star formation. Pilot observations of 23 sites of methanol maser emission were made, with the detection of ground-state hydroxyl masers towards 11 of these and six additional offset sites. Of these 17 sites, nine are new detections of sites of 1665-MHz maser emission, three of them accompanied by 1667-MHz emission. More than 70 per cent of the maser features have significant circular polarization, whilst only ˜10 per cent have significant linear polarization (although some features with up to 100 per cent linear polarization are found). We find 11 Zeeman pairs across six sites of high-mass star formation with implied magnetic field strengths between -1.5 and +3.8 mG and a median field strength of +1.6 mG. Our measurements of Zeeman splitting imply that a coherent field orientation is experienced by the maser sites across a distance of 5.3 $\pm$ 2.0 kpc within the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm tangent.

AB  - We describe a simple step-by-step guide to qualitative interpretation of galaxy spectra. Rather than an alternative to existing automated tools, it is put forward as an instrument for quick-look analysis and for gaining physical insight when interpreting the outputs provided by automated tools. Though the recipe is for general application, it was developed for understanding the nature of the Automatic Spectroscopic K-means-based (ASK) template spectra. They resulted from the classification of all the galaxy spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7, thus being a comprehensive representation of the galaxy spectra in the local universe. Using the recipe, we give a description of the properties of the gas and the stars that characterize the ASK classes, from those corresponding to passively evolving galaxies, to H II galaxies undergoing a galaxy-wide starburst. The qualitative analysis is found to be in excellent agreement with quantitative analyses of the same spectra. We compare the mean ages of the stellar populations with those inferred using the code STARLIGHT. We also examine the estimated gas-phase metallicity with the metallicities obtained using electron-temperature-based methods. A number of byproducts follow from the analysis. There is a tight correlation between the age of the stellar population and the metallicity of the gas, which is stronger than the correlations between galaxy mass and stellar age, and galaxy mass and gas metallicity. The galaxy spectra are known to follow a one-dimensional sequence, and we identify the luminosity-weighted mean stellar age as the affine parameter that describes the sequence. All ASK classes happen to have a significant fraction of old stars, although spectrum-wise they are outshined by the youngest populations. Old stars are metal-rich or metal-poor depending on whether they reside in passive galaxies or in star-forming galaxies.

AB  - We propose that the cloud moving on a highly eccentric orbit near the central black hole in our Galaxy, reported by Gillessen et al., is formed by a photoevaporation wind originating in a disk around a star that is tidally perturbed and shocked at every peribothron passage. The disk is proposed to have formed when a stellar black hole flew by the star, tidally disrupted its envelope, and placed the star on its present orbit with some of the tidal debris forming a disk. A disrupting encounter at the location of the observed cloud is most likely to be caused by a stellar black hole because of the expected dynamical mass segregation; the rate of these disk-forming encounters may be as high as ~10-6 per year. The star should also be spun up by the encounter, so the disk may subsequently expand by absorbing angular momentum from the star. Once the disk expands up to the tidal truncation radius, the tidal perturbation of the outer disk edge at every peribothron may place gas streams on larger orbits, which can give rise to a photoevaporation wind that forms the cloud at every orbit. This model predicts that, after the cloud is disrupted at the next peribothron passage in 2013, a smaller unresolved cloud will gradually grow around the star on the same present orbit. An increased infrared luminosity from the disk may also be detectable when the peribothron is reached. We also note that this model revives the encounter theory for planet formation.

AB  - Recently, an ionized cloud of gas was discovered plunging towards the supermassive black hole, SgrA*, at the centre of the Milky Way. The cloud is being tidally disrupted along its path to closest approach at ~3,100 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole. Here we show that the observed properties of this cloud of gas can naturally be produced by a proto-planetary disc surrounding a low-mass star, which was scattered from the observed ring of young stars orbiting SgrA*. As the young star approaches the black hole, its disc experiences both photoevaporation and tidal disruption, producing a cloud. Our model implies that planets form in the Galactic centre, and that tidal debris from proto-planetary discs can flag low-mass stars, which are otherwise too faint to be detected.

AB  - The recent discovery by Gillessen and collaborators of a cloud of gas falling towards the Galactic center on a highly eccentric orbit, diving nearly straight into the immediate neighborhood of the central supermassive black hole, raises the important question of its origin. Several models have already been proposed. Here we suggest that a recent nova outburst has ejected a ring-like shell of gas. Viewed at high inclination, that could account for the mass, head and tail structure, and the unusually high eccentricity of the observed cloud in a natural way, even as the nova moves on a quite normal orbit for the young stars in the close neighborhood of the Galactic center. We illustrate this by calculating orbits for the head and tail parts of the ejecta and the nova that has produced it. We briefly discuss some of the questions that this model, if true, raises about the stellar environment close to the Galactic center.

AB  - A dense ionized cloud of gas has been recently discovered to be moving directly toward the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, at the Galactic center. In 2013 June, at the pericenter of its highly eccentric orbit, the cloud will be approximately 3100 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole and will move supersonically through the ambient hot gas with a velocity of vp ≈ 5400 km s-1. A bow shock is likely to form in front of the cloud and could accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. We estimate via particle-in-cell simulations the energy distribution of the accelerated electrons and show that the non-thermal synchrotron emission from these electrons might exceed the quiescent radio emission from Sgr A* by a factor of several. The enhanced radio emission should be detectable at GHz and higher frequencies around the time of pericentric passage and in the following months. The bow shock emission is expected to be displaced from the quiescent radio emission of Sgr A* by ~33 mas. Interferometric observations could resolve potential changes in the radio image of Sgr A* at wavelengths <~ 6 cm.

AB  - This review summarizes a few of the frontiers of Galactic center research that are currently the focus of considerable activity and attention. It is aimed at providing a necessarily incomplete sketch of some of the timely work being done on phenomena taking place in, or originating in, the central few parsecs of the Galaxy, with particular attention to topics related to the Galactic black hole (GBH). We have chosen to expand on the following exciting topics: 1) the characterization and the implications for the variability of emission from the GBH, 2) the strong evidence for a powerful X-ray flare in the Galactic center within the past few hundred years, and the likelihood that the GBH is implicated in that event, 3) the prospects for detecting the shadow" of the GBH, 4) an overview of the current state of research on the central S-star cluster, and what has been learned from the stellar orbits within that cluster, and 5) the current hypotheses for the origin of the G2 dust cloud that is projected to make a close passage by the GBH in 2013.

AB  - Although grand-design spiral galaxies are relatively common in the local Universe, only one has been spectroscopically confirmed to lie at redshift z>2 (HDFX 28; z = 2.011); and it may prove to be a major merger that simply resembles a spiral in projection. The rarity of spirals has been explained as a result of disks being dynamically `hot' at z>2 (refs 2-5), which may instead favour the formation of commonly observed clumpy structures. Alternatively, current instrumentation may simply not be sensitive enough to detect spiral structures comparable to those in the modern Universe. At z<2, the velocity dispersion of disks decreases, and spiral galaxies are more numerous by z~1 (refs 7, 13-15). Here we report observations of the grand-design spiral galaxy Q2343-BX442 at z = 2.18. Spectroscopy of ionized gas shows that the disk is dynamically hot, implying an uncertain origin for the spiral structure. The kinematics of the galaxy are consistent with a thick disk undergoing a minor merger, which can drive the formation of short-lived spiral structure. A duty cycle of <100Myr for such tidally induced spiral structure in a hot massive disk is consistent with its rarity.

AB  - A dataset of 126,501 spiral galaxies taken from Sloan Digital Sky Survey was used to analyze the large-scale galaxy handedness in different regions of the local universe. The analysis was automated by using a transformation of the galaxy images to their radial intensity plots, which allows automatic analysis of the galaxy spin and can therefore be used to analyze a large galaxy dataset. The results show that the local universe (z<0.3) is not isotropic in terms of galaxy spin, with probability P<˜5.8s10-6 of such asymmetry to occur by chance. The handedness asymmetries exhibit an approximate cosine dependence, and the most likely dipole axis was found at RA=132$\,^\circ$, DEC=32$\,^\circ$ with 1sigma error range of 107$\,^\circ$-179$\,^\circ$ for the RA. The probability of such axis to occur by chance is P<1.95s10-5. The amplitude of the handedness asymmetry reported in this Letter is generally in agreement with Longo, but the statistical significance is improved by a factor of 40, and the direction of the axis disagrees somewhat.

AB  - Context. The majority of all galaxies reside in groups of fewer than 50 member galaxies. These groups are distributed in various large-scale environments from voids to superclusters. Aims: The evolution of galaxies is affected by the environment in which they reside. Our aim is to study the effects of the local group scale and the supercluster scale environments on galaxy evolution. Methods: We use a luminosity-density field to determine the density of the large-scale environment of galaxies in groups of various richnesses. We calculate the fractions of different types of galaxies in groups with richnesses of up to 50 member galaxies and in different large-scale environments from voids to superclusters. Results: The fraction of passive elliptical galaxies rises and the fraction of star-forming spiral galaxies declines when the richness of a group of galaxies rises from two to approximately ten galaxies. On large scales, passive elliptical galaxies become more numerous than star-forming spirals when the environmental density grows to values typical of superclusters. The large-scale environment affects the level of these fractions in groups: galaxies in equally rich groups are more likely to be elliptical in supercluster environments than at lower densities. The crossing point, where the number of passive and star-forming galaxies is equal, occurs in superclusters in groups that are of lower richness than in voids. Galaxies in low-density environments need to occupy richer groups to evolve from star-forming to passive than galaxies in high-density environments. Groups in superclusters are on average more luminous than groups in large-scale environments of lower density. These results imply that the large-scale environment affects the properties of galaxies and groups. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the evolution of galaxies is affected by both, the group in which the galaxy resides and its large-scale environment. Galaxies in lower-density regions develop later than galaxies in similar mass groups in high-density environments.

AB  - The parsec-scale radio properties of 232 active galactic nuclei, most of which are blazars, detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope have been observed contemporaneously by the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 5 GHz. Data from both the first 11 months (1FGL) and the first 2 years (2FGL) of the Fermi mission were used to investigate these sources' gamma-ray properties. We use the ratio of the gamma-ray-to-radio luminosity as a measure of gamma-ray loudness. We investigate the relationship of several radio properties to gamma-ray loudness and to the synchrotron peak frequency. There is a tentative correlation between gamma-ray loudness and synchrotron peak frequency for BL Lac objects in both 1FGL and 2FGL, and for flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) in 2FGL. We find that the apparent opening angle tentatively correlates with gamma-ray loudness for FSRQs, but only when we use the 2FGL data. We also find that the total VLBA flux density correlates with the synchrotron peak frequency for BL Lac objects and FSRQs. The core brightness temperature also correlates with synchrotron peak frequency, but only for the BL Lac objects. The low-synchrotron-peaked (LSP) BL Lac object sample shows indications of contamination by FSRQs which happen to have undetectable emission lines. There is evidence that the LSP BL Lac objects are more strongly beamed than the rest of the BL Lac object population.

We find a correlation between the derived jet powers and AGN narrow-line luminosity, consistent with the well-known relation for radio galaxies and steep spectrum quasars. This technique can be applied to intrinsically weak jets even at high redshift.

AB  - In order to find more examples of the elusive high-redshift molecular absorbers, we have embarked on a systematic discovery program for highly obscured, radio-loud "invisible active galactic nuclei" using the Very Large Array Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters radio survey in conjunction with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to identify 82 strong (>=300 mJy) radio sources positionally coincident with late-type, presumably gas-rich galaxies. In this first paper, the basic properties of this sample are described including the selection process and the analysis of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) derived from the optical (SDSS) + near-IR (NIR) photometry obtained by us at the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m. The NIR images confirm the late-type galaxy morphologies found by SDSS for these sources in all but a few (6 of 70) cases (12 previously well studied or misclassified sources were culled). Among 70 sources in the final sample, 33 show galaxy type SEDs, 17 have galaxy components to their SEDs, and 20 have quasar power-law continua. At least nine sources with galaxy SEDs have K-band flux densities too faint to be giant ellipticals if placed at their photometric redshifts. Photometric redshifts for this sample are analyzed and found to be too inaccurate for an efficient radio-frequency absorption line search; spectroscopic redshifts are required. A few new spectroscopic redshifts for these sources are presented here but more will be needed to make significant progress in this field. Subsequent papers will describe the radio continuum properties of the sample and the search for redshifted H I 21 cm absorption.

AB  - Using multiwavelength surveys of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) across a wide range of bolometric luminosities (1043 < L bol (erg s--1) <5 × 1046) and redshifts (0 < z < 3), we find a strong, redshift-independent correlation between the AGN luminosity and the fraction of host galaxies undergoing a major merger. That is, only the most luminous AGN phases are connected to major mergers, while less luminous AGNs appear to be driven by secular processes. Combining this trend with AGN luminosity functions to assess the overall cosmic growth of black holes, we find that ~50% by mass is associated with major mergers, while only 10% of AGNs by number, the most luminous, are connected to these violent events. Our results suggest that to reach the highest AGN luminosities---where the most massive black holes accreted the bulk of their mass---a major merger appears to be required. The luminosity dependence of the fraction of AGNs triggered by major mergers can successfully explain why the observed scatter in the M-sigma relation for elliptical galaxies is significantly lower than in spirals. The lack of a significant redshift dependence of the L bol-f merger relation suggests that downsizing, i.e., the general decline in AGN and star formation activity with decreasing redshift, is driven by a decline in the frequency of major mergers combined with a decrease in the availability of gas at lower redshifts.

AB  - In accretion-based models for Sgr A*, the X-ray, infrared, and millimeter emission arise in a hot, geometrically thick accretion flow close to the black hole. The spectrum and size of the source depend on the black hole mass accretion rate M. Since Gillessen et al. have recently discovered a cloud moving toward Sgr A* that will arrive in summer 2013, M may increase from its present value M_0. We therefore reconsider the "best-bet" accretion model of Moscibrodzka et al., which is based on a general relativistic MHD flow model and fully relativistic radiative transfer, for a range of M. We find that for modest increases in M the characteristic ring of emission due to the photon orbit becomes brighter, more extended, and easier to detect by the planned Event Horizon Telescope submillimeter Very Long Baseline Interferometry experiment. If M \gtrsim 8 \,M_0, this "silhouette" of the black hole will be hidden beneath the synchrotron photosphere at 230 GHz, and for M \gtrsim 16 \,M_0 the silhouette is hidden at 345 GHz. We also find that for M > 2 \,M_0 the near-horizon accretion flow becomes a persistent X-ray and mid-infrared source, and in the near-infrared Sgr A* will acquire a persistent component that is brighter than currently observed flares.

AB  - We investigate the origin, structure, and evolution of the small gas cloud G2, which is on an orbit almost straight into the Galactic central supermassive black hole (SMBH). G2 is a sensitive probe of the hot accretion zone of Sgr A*, requiring gas temperatures and densities that agree well with models of captured shock-heated stellar winds. Its mass is equal to the critical mass below which cold clumps would be destroyed quickly by evaporation. Its mass is also constrained by the fact that at apocenter its sound crossing timescale was equal to its infall timescale. Our numerical simulations show that the observed structure and evolution of G2 can be well reproduced if it forms in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings in 1995 at a distance from the SMBH of 7.6 × 1016 cm. If the cloud had formed at apocenter in the "clockwise" stellar disk as expected from its orbit, it would be torn into a very elongated spaghetti-like filament by 2011, which is not observed. This problem can be solved if G2 is the head of a larger, shell-like structure that formed at apocenter. Our numerical simulations show that this scenario explains not only G2's observed kinematical and geometrical properties but also the Brgamma observations of a low surface brightness gas tail that trails the cloud. In 2013, while passing the SMBH, G2 will break up into a string of droplets that within the next 30 years will mix with the surrounding hot gas and trigger cycles of active galactic nucleus activity.

AB  - Upcoming next generation galactic surveys, such as Gaia and HERMES, will deliver unprecedented detail about the structure and make-up of our Galaxy, the Milky Way, and promise to radically improve our understanding of it. However, to benefit our broader knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution we first need to quantify how typical the Galaxy is with respect to other galaxies of its type. Through modeling and comparison with a large sample of galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Galaxy Zoo, we provide tentative yet tantalizing evidence to show that both the Milky Way and nearby M31 are undergoing a critical transformation of their global properties. Both appear to possess attributes that are consistent with galaxies midway between the distinct blue and red bimodal color populations. In extragalactic surveys, such "green valley" galaxies are transition objects whose star formation typically will have all but extinguished in less than 5 Gyr. This finding reveals the possible future of our own galactic home and opens a new window of opportunity to study such galactic transformations up close.

AB  - We present a sample of 723 optically selected BL Lac candidates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) spectroscopic database encompassing 8250 deg2 of sky; our sample constitutes one of the largest uniform BL Lac samples yet derived. Each BL Lac candidate has a high-quality SDSS spectrum from which we determine spectroscopic redshifts for ~60% of the objects. Redshift lower limits are estimated for the remaining objects utilizing the lack of host galaxy flux contamination in their optical spectra; we find that objects lacking spectroscopic redshifts are likely at systematically higher redshifts. Approximately 80% of our BL Lac candidates match to a radio source in FIRST/NVSS, and ~40% match to a ROSAT X-ray source. The homogeneous multiwavelength coverage allows subdivision of the sample into 637 radio-loud BL Lac candidates and 86 weak-featured radio-quiet objects. The radio-loud objects broadly support the standard paradigm unifying BL Lac objects with beamed radio galaxies. We propose that the majority of the radio-quiet objects may be lower-redshift (z < 2.2) analogs to high-redshift weak line quasars (i.e., active galactic nucleus with unusually anemic broad emission line regions). These would constitute the largest sample of such objects, being of similar size and complementary in redshift to the samples of high-redshift weak line quasars previously discovered by the SDSS. However, some fraction of the weak-featured radio-quiet objects may instead populate a rare and extreme radio-weak tail of the much larger radio-loud BL Lac population. Serendipitous discoveries of unusual white dwarfs, high-redshift weak line quasars, and broad absorption line quasars with extreme continuum dropoffs blueward of rest-frame 2800 Å are also briefly described.

However, the scientific challenges outlined in this book are today's problems   will they still be the outstanding problems that will confront astronomers in the period 2020 2050 and beyond, when the SKA will be in its most productive years? If history is any example, the excitement of the SKA will not be in the old questions which are answered, but the new questions that will be raised by the new types of observations it will permit. The SKA is a tool for as-yet-unborn users and there is an onus on its designers to allow for the exploration of the unknown. We outline a philosophy for the design and operation of the SKA that can lead the radio astronomers in the 21st century to add to the many discoveries of new phenomena made by radio astronomers in the 20th century.

AB  - In this paper, we present the Clustering-Labels-Score Patterns Spotter (CLaSPS), a new methodology for the determination of correlations among astronomical observables in complex data sets, based on the application of distinct unsupervised clustering techniques. The novelty in CLaSPS is the criterion used for the selection of the optimal clusterings, based on a quantitative measure of the degree of correlation between the cluster memberships and the distribution of a set of observables, the labels, not employed for the clustering. CLaSPS has been primarily developed as a tool to tackle the challenging complexity of the multi-wavelength complex and massive astronomical data sets produced by the federation of the data from modern automated astronomical facilities. In this paper, we discuss the applications of CLaSPS to two simple astronomical data sets, both composed of extragalactic sources with photometric observations at different wavelengths from large area surveys. The first data set, CSC+, is composed of optical quasars spectroscopically selected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, observed in the x-rays by Chandra and with multi-wavelength observations in the near-infrared, optical, and ultraviolet spectral intervals. One of the results of the application of CLaSPS to the CSC+ is the re-identification of a well-known correlation between the alphaOX parameter and the near-ultraviolet color, in a subset of CSC+ sources with relatively small values of the near-ultraviolet colors. The other data set consists of a sample of blazars for which photometric observations in the optical, mid-, and near-infrared are available, complemented for a subset of the sources, by Fermi gamma-ray data. The main results of the application of CLaSPS to such data sets have been the discovery of a strong correlation between the multi-wavelength color distribution of blazars and their optical spectral classification in BL Lac objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars, and a peculiar pattern followed by blazars in the WISE mid-infrared colors space. This pattern and its physical interpretation have been discussed in detail in other papers by one of the authors.

AB  - Blazars constitute the most enigmatic class of extragalactic gamma-ray sources, and their observational features have been ascribed to a relativistic jet closely aligned to the line of sight. They are generally divided in two main classes: the BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) and the flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). In the case of BL Lacs the double-bumped spectral energy distribution (SED) is generally described by the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission, while for the FSRQs it is interpreted as due to external Compton (EC) emission. Recently, we showed that in the [3.4]-[4.6]-[12] mum color-color diagram the blazar population covers a distinct region (i.e., the WISE blazar Strip (WBS)) clearly separated from the other extragalactic sources that are dominated by thermal emission. In this paper, we investigate the relation between the infrared and gamma-ray emission for a subset of confirmed blazars from the literature, associated with Fermi sources, for which WISE archival observations are available. This sample is a proper subset of the sample of sources used previously, and the availability of Fermi data is critical to constrain the models on the emission mechanisms for the blazars. We found that the selected blazars also lie on the WBS covering a narrower region of the infrared color-color planes than the overall blazar population. We then found an evident correlation between the IR and gamma-ray spectral indices expected in the SSC and EC frameworks. Finally, we determined the ratio between their gamma-ray and infrared fluxes, a surrogate of the ratio of powers between the inverse Compton and the synchrotron SED components, and used such parameter to test different blazar emitting scenarios.

AB  - Astronomical researchers often think of analysis and visualization as separate tasks. In the case of high-dimensional data sets, though, interactive exploratory data visualization can give far more insight than an approach where data processing and statistical analysis are followed, rather than accompanied, by visualization. This paper attempts to charts a course toward ``linked view" systems, where multiple views of high-dimensional data sets update live as a researcher selects, highlights, or otherwise manipulates, one of several open views. For example, imagine a researcher looking at a 3D volume visualization of simulated or observed data, and simultaneously viewing statistical displays of the data set's properties (such as an x-y plot of temperature vs. velocity, or a histogram of vorticities). Then, imagine that when the researcher selects an interesting group of points in any one of these displays, that the same points become a highlighted subset in all other open displays. Selections can be graphical or algorithmic, and they can be combined, and saved. For tabular (ASCII) data, this kind of analysis has long been possible, even though it has been under-used in astronomy. The bigger issue for astronomy and other ``high-dimensional" fields, though, is that no extant system allows for full integration of images and data cubes within a linked-view environment. The paper concludes its history and analysis of the present situation with suggestions that look toward cooperatively-developed open-source modular software as a way to create an evolving, flexible, high-dimensional, linked-view visualization environment useful in astrophysical research.

AB  - We present details of the construction and characterization of the coaddition of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 \ugriz\ imaging data. This survey consists of 275 deg$^2$ of repeated scanning by the SDSS camera of $2.5\arcdeg$ of $\delta$ over $-50\arcdeg \le \alpha \le 60\arcdeg$ centered on the Celestial Equator. Each piece of sky has $\sim 20$ runs contributing and thus reaches $\sim2$ magnitudes fainter than the SDSS single pass data, i.e. to $r\sim 23.5$ for galaxies. We discuss the image processing of the coaddition, the modeling of the PSF, the calibration, and the production of standard SDSS catalogs. The data have $r$-band median seeing of 1.1\arcsec, and are calibrated to $\le 1%$. Star color-color, number counts, and psf size vs modelled size plots show the modelling of the PSF is good enough for precision 5-band photometry. Structure in the psf-model vs magnitude plot show minor psf mis-modelling that leads to a region where stars are being mis-classified as galaxies, and this is verified using VVDS spectroscopy. As this is a wide area deep survey there are a variety of uses for the data, including galactic structure, photometric redshift computation, cluster finding and cross wavelength measurements, weak lensing cluster mass calibrations, and cosmic shear measurements.

AB  - Context: Morphology is the most accessible tracer of the physical structure of galaxies, but its interpretation in the framework of galaxy evolution still remains a problem. Its dependence on wavelength renders the comparison between local and high redshift populations difficult. Furthermore, the quality of the measured morphology being strongly dependent on the image resolution, the comparison between different surveys is also a problem.   Aims: We present a new non-parametric method to quantify morphologies of galaxies based on a particular family of learning machines called support vector machines. The method, which can be seen as a generalization of the classical C/A classification but with an unlimited number of dimensions and non-linear boundaries between decision regions, is fully automated and thus particularly well adapted to large cosmological surveys. The source code is available for download at http://www.lesia.obspm.fr/~huertas/galsvm.html   Methods: To test the method, we use a seeing limited near-infrared (Ks band, 2,16 mum) sample observed with WIRCam at CFHT at a median redshift of z ~ 0.8. The machine is trained with a simulated sample built from a local visually classified sample from the SDSS, chosen in the high-redshift sample's rest-frame (i band, 0.77 mum) and artificially redshifted to match the observing conditions. We use a 12-dimensional volume, including 5 morphological parameters, and other characteristics of galaxies such as luminosity and redshift. A fraction of the simulated sample is used to test the machine and assess its accuracy.   Results: We show that a qualitative separation in two main morphological types (late type and early type) can be obtained with an error lower than 20% up to the completeness limit of the sample (KAB ~ 22), which is more than 2 times better that what would be obtained with a classical C/A classification on the same sample and indeed comparable to space data. The method is optimized to solve a specific problem, offering an objective and automated estimate of errors that enables a straightforward comparison with other surveys. Selecting the training sample in the high-redshift sample rest-frame makes the results free from wavelength dependent effects and hence its interpretation in terms of evolution easier.  Based on observations obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii  Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research  Council of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers  of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and  the University of Hawaii.

AB  - We constructed a sample of 185 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) by cross-correlating Shen et al.'s Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3 (SDSS DR3) X-ray quasar sample with the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and Green Bank 6-cm survey (GB6) radio catalogues. From the spectral energy distribution (SED) constructed using multi-band (radio, UV, optical, infrared and X-ray) data, we derived the synchrotron peak frequency and peak luminosity. The black hole mass MBH and the broad-line region (BLR) luminosity (then the bolometric luminosity Lbol) were obtained by measuring the linewidth and strength of broad emission lines from SDSS spectra. We define a subsample of 118 FSRQs for which non-thermal jet emission is thought to dominate over thermal emission from the accretion disc and host galaxy. For this subsample, we found 25 FSRQs having synchrotron peak frequency nupeak > 1015Hz, which is higher than the typical value for FSRQs. These sources with high nupeak could be targets for the Fermi gamma-ray telescope. Only a weak anti-correlation is found between the synchrotron peak frequency and peak luminosity, while no strong correlation is present between either the synchrotron peak frequency and black hole mass or the synchrotron peak frequency and the Eddington ratio Lbol/LEdd. When combining the FSRQ subsample with Wu et al.'s sample of 170 BL Lac objects, a strong anti-correlation between the synchrotron peak frequency and luminosity is apparently present, covering about seven orders of magnitude in nupeak. However, the anti-correlation differs from the blazar sequence in having large scatter. At a similar peak frequency, the peak luminosity of FSRQs with nupeak > 1015Hz is systematically higher than that of BL Lac objects, with some FSRQs outside the range covered by BL Lac objects. Although high nupeak values are found in some FSRQs, they do not reach the extreme value of BL Lacs. For the subsample of 118 FSRQs, we found significant correlations between the peak luminosity and black hole mass, the Eddington ratio and the BLR luminosity, indicating that the jet physics may be strongly related to the accretion process.

AB  - We have used the VLBA at 5 GHz to observe all galaxies with nuclear radio flux densities above 3.5 mJy found in a VLA survey at 15 GHz of a sample of nearby LINER galaxies. All galaxies were detected revealing high brightness temperature (Tb>~108 K) radio sources. Free-free emission is unlikely since it greatly overpredicts the soft X-ray luminosities. We infer the presence of active galactic nucleus (AGN)-like, nonthermal radio emission most likely powered by underfed black holes. Together with our VLA sample we estimate from our observations that at least one-half of LINER galaxies host genuine AGNs. We find no evidence for highly inverted radio cores as predicted in the advection-dominated accretion flow model: the (nonsimultaneous) spectral indices are on average around alpha=0.0. In the two brightest sources we detect some extended emission, which appears to originate in jets in at least one of these galaxies. Together with the spectral indices this suggests that the nuclear emission at centimeter radio waves is largely dominated by emission from radio jets, very similar to the situation in more luminous AGNs. The energy released in these jets could be a significant fraction of the energy budget in the accretion flow.

AB  - We present the completed results of a high resolution radio imaging survey of all ( 200) low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) and AGNs in the Palomar Spectroscopic Sample of all ( 488) bright northern galaxies. The high incidences of pc-scale radio nuclei, with implied brightness temperatures ≳107 K, and sub-parsec jets argue for accreting black holes in ≳50% of all LINERs and low-luminosity Seyferts; there is no evidence against all LLAGNs being mini-AGNs. The detected parsec-scale radio nuclei are preferentially found in massive ellipticals and in type 1 nuclei (i.e. nuclei with broad Halpha emission). The radio luminosity function (RLF) of Palomar Sample LLAGNs and AGNs extends three orders of magnitude below, and is continuous with, that of ``classical'' AGNs. We find marginal evidence for a low-luminosity turnover in the RLF; nevertheless LLAGNs are responsible for a significant fraction of present day mass accretion. Adopting a model of a relativistic jet from Falcke & Biermann, we show that the accretion power output in LLAGNs is dominated by the kinetic power in the observed jets rather than the radiated bolometric luminosity. The Palomar LLAGNs and AGNs follow the same scaling between jet kinetic power and narrow line region (NLR) luminosity as the parsec to kilo-parsec jets in powerful radio galaxies. Eddington ratios l_Edd (=L_Emitted/L_Eddington) of <=10-1-10-5 are implied in jet models of the radio emission. We find evidence that, in analogy to Galactic black hole candidates, LINERs are in a ``low/hard'' state (gas poor nuclei, low Eddington ratio, ability to launch collimated jets) while low-luminosity Seyferts are in a ``high'' state (gas rich nuclei, higher Eddington ratio, less likely to launch collimated jets). In addition to dominating the radiated bolometric luminosity of the nucleus, the radio jets are energetically more significant than supernovae in the host galaxies, and are potentially able to deposit sufficient energy into the innermost parsecs to significantly slow the gas supply to the accretion disk.

AB  - We report a high-resolution (0.2"), 15 GHz survey of a sample of 48 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei with the Very Large Array.5 Compact radio emission has been detected above a flux density of 1.1 mJy in 57% (17 of 30) of low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) nuclei and low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies. The 2 cm radio power is significantly correlated with the emission-line ([O I] lambda6300) luminosity. Using radio fluxes at other frequencies from the literature, we find that at least 15 of the 18 detected radio cores have a flat to inverted spectrum (alpha>=-0.3, Snu~nualpha). While the present observations are consistent with the radio emission originating in star-forming regions (the brightness temperatures are >=102.5-4.5 K), higher resolution radio observations of 10 of the detected sources, reported in an accompanying paper, show that the cores are very compact (<~1 pc), of high brightness temperature (Tb>~108 K), and probably synchrotron self-absorbed, ruling out a starburst origin. Thus, our results suggest that at least 50% of low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies and LINERs in the sample are accretion powered, with the radio emission presumably coming from jets or advection-dominated accretion flows. We have detected only 1 of 18 ``transition'' (i.e., LINER+H II) nuclei observed, indicating that their radio cores are significantly weaker than those of ``pure'' LINERs. Compact 2 cm radio cores are found in both type 1 (i.e., with broad Halpha) and type 2 (without broad Halpha) nuclei. There is weak evidence, limited in significance by small numbers, that low-luminosity active galactic nuclei with compact radio cores exhibit radio ejecta preferentially aligned along the rotation axis of the galaxy disk. If this result were confirmed by a larger sample, it would lend support to the idea that the misalignment of accretion disks with the galaxy stellar disk in more luminous Seyfert galaxies is a result of radiation-pressure-induced warping of their accretion disks.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a high resolution radio imaging survey of all known (96) low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) at D <= 19 Mpc. We first report new 2 cm (150 mas resolution using the VLA) and 6 cm (2 mas resolution using the VLBA) radio observations of the previously unobserved nuclei in our samples and then present results on the complete survey. We find that almost half of all LINERs and low-luminosity Seyferts have flat-spectrum radio cores when observed at 150 mas resolution. Higher (2 mas) resolution observations of a flux-limited subsample have provided a 100% (16 of 16) detection rate of pc-scale radio cores, with implied brightness temperatures gtrsim 108 K. The five LLAGNs with the highest core radio fluxes also have pc-scale ``jets''. Compact radio cores are almost exclusively found in massive ellipticals and in type 1 nuclei (i.e. nuclei with broad Halpha emission). Only a few ``transition'' nuclei have compact radio cores; those detected in the radio have optical emission-line diagnostic ratios close to those of LINERs/Seyferts. This indicates that some transition nuclei are truly composite Seyfert/LINER+H II region nuclei, with the radio core power depending on the strength of the former component. The core radio power is correlated with the nuclear optical ``broad'' Halpha luminosity, the nuclear optical ``narrow'' emission-line luminosity and width, and with the galaxy luminosity. In these correlations LLAGNs fall close to the low-luminosity extrapolations of more powerful AGNs. The scalings suggest that many of the radio-non-detected LLAGNs are simply lower power versions of the radio-detected LLAGNs. The ratio of core radio power to nuclear optical emission-line luminosity increases with increasing bulge luminosity for all LLAGNs. Also, there is evidence that the luminosity of the disk component of the galaxy is correlated with the nuclear emission-line luminosity (but not the core radio power). About half of all LLAGNs with multiple epoch data show significant inter-year radio variability. Investigation of a sample of ~ 150 nearby bright galaxies, most of them LLAGNs, shows that the nuclear (<=150 mas size) radio power is strongly correlated with both the black hole mass and the galaxy bulge luminosity; linear regression fits to all ~ 150 galaxies give: log P2 cm = 1.31(+/-0.16) log MMDO + 8.77 and log P2 cm = 1.89(+/-0.21) log LB(bulge) -0.17. Low accretion rates (<=10-2-10-3 of the Eddington rate) are implied in both advection- and jet-type models. In brief, all evidence points towards the presence of accreting massive black holes in a large fraction, perhaps all, of LLAGNs, with the nuclear radio emission originating in either the accretion inflow onto the massive black hole or from jets launched by this black hole-accretion disk system.

AB  - We present simultaneous, subarcsecond (<=50 pc) resolution 5, 8.4, and 15 GHz Very Large Array observations of a well-defined sample of 16 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. The radio emission in most of these nuclei does not show the rising spectrum (0.2<~s<~1.3, Lnu~nus) expected from thermal electrons in an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) with or without weak to moderately strong outflows. Rather, the flat radio spectra are indicative of either synchrotron self-absorbed emission from jets, convection-dominated accretion flows (CDAFs) with L>~10-5LEdd, or ADAFs with strong (p>~0.6) outflows. The jet interpretation is favored by three factors: (1) the detection of parsec-scale radio extensions, morphologically reminiscent of jets, in the five nuclei with the highest peak radio flux density, (2) the domination of parsec-scale jet radio emission over unresolved ``core'' emission in the three best-studied nuclei, and (3) the lack of any clear correlation between radio spectral shape and black hole mass as would be expected from the dependence of the radio turnover frequency on black hole mass in ADAF and CDAF models. A jet domination of nuclear radio emission implies significantly lower accretion rates in ADAF-type models than earlier estimated from core radio luminosities.

AB  - A search for a possible fourth generation charge (-1/3) quark (b^' ) is made using the 4.7 pb^ -1 of high p_t muon data collected by the UA1 experiment in the 1988 and 1989 CERN SppS collider runs at sqrt s = 630 GeV. Events with an energetic muon accompanied by hadronic jets are studied and the data is found to be in good agreement with expectations from the main background processes; known heavy flavor production and decay, and pions and kaons decaying in flight. Based on this understanding of the sources to Muoncdot Jet events, there is no evidence for the existence of a new charge (-1/3) heavy quark in this data sample. This result is combined with the result from the previous UA1 search for a b^' . Using this total data sample of 5.4 pb ^-1, a lower limit on the mass of the b^' is obtained: M_b^' > 47 GeV/c^2(95% confidence level).

AB  - We have carried out an analysis of the radio and optical properties of a statistical sample of 45 Seyfert galaxies from the Palomar spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies. We find that the space density of bright galaxies (-22 mag<=MBT<=-18 mag) showing Seyfert activity is (1.25+/-0.38)×10-3 Mpc-3, considerably higher than found in other Seyfert samples. Host galaxy types, radio spectra, and radio source sizes are uncorrelated with Seyfert type, as predicted by the unified schemes for active galaxies. Approximately half of the detected galaxies have flat or inverted radio spectra, more than expected based on previous samples. Surprisingly, Seyfert 1 galaxies are found to have somewhat stronger radio sources than Seyfert 2 galaxies at 6 and 20 cm, particularly among the galaxies with the weakest nuclear activity. We suggest that this difference can be accommodated in the unified schemes if a minimum level of Seyfert activity is required for a radio source to emerge from the vicinity of the active nucleus. Below this level, Seyfert radio sources might be suppressed by free-free absorption associated with the nuclear torus or a compact narrow-line region, thus accounting for both the weakness of the radio emission and the preponderance of flat spectra. Alternatively, the flat spectra and weak radio sources might indicate that the weak active nuclei are fed by advection-dominated accretion disks.

AB  - We have used the Very Large Array (VLA) to conduct a survey for radio continuum emission in the sample of 52 Seyfert nuclei selected from the optical spectroscopic galaxy catalog of Ho, Filippenko, & Sargent. This Seyfert sample is the most complete and least biased available, and, as such, it will be useful for a variety of statistical analyses. Here we present the observations, measurements, and an atlas of radio maps. The observations were made at 6 cm in the B array and at 20 cm in the A array, yielding matched angular resolutions of ~1". We detected 44 objects (85%) at 6 cm and 37 objects (71%) at 20 cm above a 3 sigma threshold of 0.12 mJy beam-1. The sources have a wide range of radio powers (P~1018-1025 W Hz-1), spectral indices (alpha206~+0.5 to -1), and linear sizes (L~few tens pc-15 kpc). The morphology of the radio emission is predominantly that of a compact core, either unresolved or slightly resolved, occasionally accompanied by elongated, jetlike features. Linearly polarized emission was detected at 6 cm in 12 sources, nine of which were also detected at 20 cm.

AB  - Historically, Seyfert nuclei have been considered to be radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We question this widely held assumption by showing that the distribution of the radio-to-optical luminosity ratio, R≡Lnu(6 cm)/Lnu(B), when properly measured for the nuclear component, places the majority of type 1 Seyfert nuclei in the category of radio-loud AGNs, defined here as objects with R>=10. This result is further strengthened by strong correlations found between radio power and optical continuum and emission-line luminosities, as has been established previously for more powerful AGNs. We also present a new calibration of the relation between optical continuum and Balmer emission-line luminosities valid in the regime of low-luminosity AGNs.

AB  - Measurements of stellar orbits provide compelling evidence that the compact radio source Sagittarius A* at the Galactic Centre is a black hole four million times the mass of the Sun. With the exception of modest X-ray and infrared flares, Sgr A* is surprisingly faint, suggesting that the accretion rate and radiation efficiency near the event horizon are currently very low. Here we report the presence of a dense gas cloud approximately three times the mass of Earth that is falling into the accretion zone of Sgr A*. Our observations tightly constrain the cloud's orbit to be highly eccentric, with an innermost radius of approach of only ~3,100 times the event horizon that will be reached in 2013. Over the past three years the cloud has begun to disrupt, probably mainly through tidal shearing arising from the black hole's gravitational force. The cloud's dynamic evolution and radiation in the next few years will probe the properties of the accretion flow and the feeding processes of the supermassive black hole. The kilo-electronvolt X-ray emission of Sgr A* may brighten significantly when the cloud reaches pericentre. There may also be a giant radiation flare several years from now if the cloud breaks up and its fragments feed gas into the central accretion zone.

AB  - We present the results of a comparison between the optical morphologies of a complete sample of 46 southern 2 Jy radio galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.05 < z < 0.7) and those of two control samples of quiescent early-type galaxies: 55 ellipticals at redshifts z <= 0.01 from the Observations of Bright Ellipticals at Yale (OBEY) survey, and 107 early-type galaxies at redshifts 0.2 < z < 0.7 in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). Based on these comparisons, we discuss the role of galaxy interactions in the triggering of powerful radio galaxies (PRGs). We find that a significant fraction of quiescent ellipticals at low and intermediate redshifts show evidence for disturbed morphologies at relatively high surface brightness levels, which are likely the result of past or on-going galaxy interactions. However, the morphological features detected in the galaxy hosts of the PRGs (e.g. tidal tails, shells, bridges, etc.) are up to 2 mag brighter than those present in their quiescent counterparts. Indeed, if we consider the same surface brightness limits, the fraction of disturbed morphologies is considerably smaller in the quiescent population (53 per cent at z < 0.2 and 48 per cent at 0.2 <= z < 0.7) than in the PRGs (93 per cent at z < 0.2 and 95 per cent at 0.2 <= z < 0.7 considering strong-line radio galaxies only). This supports a scenario in which PRGs represent a fleeting active phase of a subset of the elliptical galaxies that have recently undergone mergers/interactions. However, we demonstrate that only a small proportion (≲20 per cent) of disturbed early-type galaxies are capable of hosting powerful radio sources.

AB  - We present deep Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph South (GMOS-S)/Gemini optical broad-band images for a complete sample of 46 southern 2 Jy radio galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.05 < z < 0.7). Based on them, we discuss the role of galaxy interactions in the triggering of powerful radio galaxies (PRGs). The high-quality observations presented here show for the first time that the overall majority of PRGs at intermediate redshifts (78-85 per cent) show peculiarities in their optical morphologies at relatively high levels of surface brightness (?; ?). The observed morphological peculiarities include tails, fans, bridges, shells, dust lanes, irregular features, amorphous haloes and multiple nuclei. While the results for many of the galaxies are consistent with them being observed at, or after, the time of coalescence of the nuclei in a galaxy merger, we find that more than one-third of the sample are observed in a pre-coalescence phase of the merger, or following a close encounter between galaxies that will not necessarily lead to a merger. By dividing the sample into Weak-Line Radio Galaxies (WLRGs; 11 objects) and Strong-Line Radio Galaxies (SLRGs; 35 objects) we find that only 27 per cent of the former show clear evidence for interactions in their optical morphologies, in contrast to the SLRGs, of which at least 94 per cent appear interacting. This is consistent with the idea that many WLRGs are fuelled/triggered by the Bondi accretion of hot gas. However, the evidence for interactions and dust features in a fraction of them indicates that the accretion of cold gas cannot always be ruled out. Of the 28 per cent of the sample that display evidence for significant starburst activity, we find that 92 per cent present disturbed morphologies, following the same general trend as the total and SLRG samples. By comparing our PRGs with various samples of quiescent ellipticals from the literature, we conclude that the percentage of morphological disturbance that we find here exceeds that found for quiescent ellipticals when similar surface brightnesses are considered. Overall, our study indicates that galaxy interactions are likely to play a key role in the triggering of active galactic nuclei (AGN)/jet activity.

AB  - We examine the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function (LF) using a sample of over 2000 galaxies, with 0.12<z<0.55 and 17.0<R_C<21.5, drawn from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (CNOC2), at present the largest such sample at intermediate redshifts. We use UBVR_CI_C photometry and the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of Coleman, Wu, and Weedman to classify our galaxies into early, intermediate, and late types, for which we compute LFs in the rest-frame B, R_C, and U bandpasses. In particular, we adopt a convenient parameterization of LF evolution including luminosity and number density evolution and take care to quantify correlations among our LF evolution parameters. We also carefully measure and account for sample selection effects as functions of galaxy magnitude and color. Our principal result is a clear quantitative separation of luminosity and density evolution for different galaxy populations and the finding that the character of the LF evolution is strongly dependent on galaxy type. Specifically, we find that the early- and intermediate-type LFs show primarily brightening at higher redshifts and only modest density evolution, whereas the late-type LF is best fit by strong number density increases at higher z with little luminosity evolution. We also confirm the trend seen in previous smaller z<~1 samples of the contrast between the strongly increasing luminosity density of late-type galaxies and the relatively constant luminosity density of early-type objects. Specific comparisons against the Canada-France and Autofib redshift surveys show general agreement among our LF evolution results, although there remain some detailed discrepancies. In addition, we use our number count and color distribution data to further confirm the validity of our LF evolution models to z~0.75, and we also show that our results are not significantly affected by potential systematic effects such as surface brightness selection, photometric errors, or redshift incompleteness.

Our statistical sample is composed of 12,473 galaxies with known redshifts down to I = 20.4 (AB). Our results at low redshift are consistent with those from Sloan Digital Sky Survey; at higher redshift, we find strong evidence for evolution in the luminosity function, including differential evolution between blue and red galaxies. We find that the luminosity density evolves as (1 + z)(0.54 $\pm$ 0.64) for red galaxies and (1 + z)(1.64 $\pm$ 0.39) for blue galaxies.

AB  - Luminosity functions and their integrated luminosity densities are presented for the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS). This ongoing survey ultimately aims to measure around 150000 redshifts and 15000 peculiar velocities over almost the entire southern sky at |b| > 10$\,^\circ$. The main target samples are taken from the 2-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) Extended Source Catalog and the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey catalogue, and comprise 138226 galaxies complete to (K, H, J, rF, bJ) = (12.75, 13.00, 13.75, 15.60, 16.75). These samples are comparable in size to the optically selected Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) samples, and improve on recent near-infrared-selected redshift surveys by more than an order of magnitude in both number and sky coverage. The partial samples used in this paper contain a little over half of the total sample in each band and are ~90 per cent complete.  Luminosity distributions are derived using the 1/Vmax, Sandage-Tammann-Yahil (STY) and step-wise maximum likelihood (SWML) estimators, and probe 1-2 absolute magnitudes fainter in the near-infrared than previous surveys. The effects of magnitude errors, redshift incompleteness and peculiar velocities have been taken into account and corrected throughout. Generally, the 6dFGS luminosity functions are in excellent agreement with those of similarly sized surveys. Our data are of sufficient quality to demonstrate that a Schechter function is not an ideal fit to the true luminosity distribution, due to its inability to simultaneously match the faint-end slope and rapid bright-end decline. Integrated luminosity densities from the 6dFGS are consistent with an old stellar population and moderately declining star formation rate.

AB  - We present number counts, luminosity functions (LFs) and luminosity densities of galaxies obtained using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Sixth Data Release (SDSS DR6) in all SDSS photometric bands. Thanks to the SDSS DR6, galaxy statistics have increased by a factor of ~7 in the u band and by a factor between ~3 and ~5 in the rest of the SDSS bands with respect to the previous work of Blanton et al. In addition, we have ensured a high redshift completeness in our galaxy samples, mainly by minimizing the effect of brightness-dependent incompleteness. With these advances, we have estimated very accurate SDSS DR6 LFs at both the bright and the faint end. In the 0.1r band, our LF is well fitted by a Schechter LF with parameters Phi* = 0.93 +/- 0.07,M* - 5log10h = -20.71 +/- 0.04 and alpha = -1.26 +/- 0.02. As compared with previous results, we find some notable differences. At the bright end of the 0.1u-band LF we find a remarkable excess, of ~1.7dex at , with respect to the best-fitting Schechter LF. This excess weakens in the 0.1g band, fading away towards the very red 0.1z band. A preliminary analysis on the nature of this bright-end bump reveals that it is composed of quasi-stellar objects/type 1 Seyferts (~60per cent), starbursts and star-forming galaxies (~20 per cent) and normal galaxies (~20 per cent). It seems, therefore, that an important fraction of this excess luminosity may come from nuclear activity. At the faint end of the SDSS DR6 LFs, where we can reach 0.5-1mag deeper than the previous SDSS LF estimations, we obtain a steeper slope that increases from the 0.1u band, with alpha = -1.05 +/- 0.05, to the very red 0.1z band, with alpha = -1.26 +/- 0.03. We have also investigated the effect of galaxy evolution on our LFs. These state-of-the-art results may be used to constrain a variety of aspects of star formation histories and/or feedback processes in galaxy formation models.

AB  - Bivariate luminosity functions (LFs) are computed for galaxies in the New York Value-Added Galaxy Catalogue, based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4. The galaxy properties investigated are the morphological type, inverse concentration index, Sérsic index, absolute effective surface brightness (SB), reference frame colours, absolute radius, eClass spectral type, stellar mass and galaxy environment. The morphological sample is flux limited to galaxies with r < 15.9 and consists of 37047 classifications to an rms accuracy of +/- half a class in the sequence E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd, Im. These were assigned by an artificial neural network, based on a training set of 645 eyeball classifications. The other samples use r < 17.77 with a median redshift of z ~ 0.08, and a limiting redshift of z < 0.15 to minimize the effects of evolution. Other cuts, for example in axis ratio, are made to minimize biases. A wealth of detail is seen, with clear variations between the LFs according to absolute magnitude and the second parameter. They are consistent with an early-type, bright, concentrated, red population and a late-type, faint, less concentrated, blue, star-forming population. This bimodality suggests two major underlying physical processes, which in agreement with previous authors we hypothesize to be merger and accretion, associated with the properties of bulges and discs, respectively. The bivariate luminosity-SB distribution is fit with the Choloniewski function (a Schechter function in absolute magnitude and Gaussian in SB). The fit is found to be poor, as might be expected if there are two underlying processes.

AB  - Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) is a project to study galaxy formation and evolution, combining imaging data from ultraviolet to radio with spectroscopic data from the AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Using data from Phase 1 of GAMA, taken over three observing seasons, and correcting for various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands.  At low redshift, z < 0.1, we find that blue galaxies, defined according to a magnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fitted over a range of more than 10 magnitudes by simple Schechter functions in all bands. Red galaxies, and the combined blue plus red sample, require double power-law Schechter functions to fit a dip in their LF faintwards of the characteristic magnitude M* before a steepening faint end. This upturn is at least partly due to dust-reddened disc galaxies.  We measure the evolution of the galaxy LF over the redshift range 0.002 < z < 0.5 both by using a parametric fit and by measuring binned LFs in redshift slices. The characteristic luminosity L* is found to increase with redshift in all bands, with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. The comoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that of red galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud to red sequence. As well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxies also dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z~= 0.2. At lower redshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the riz bands, and by blue galaxies in u and g.

AB  - We construct and analyse a u-band selected galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Southern Survey, which covers 275deg2. The sample includes 43223 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0.005 < z < 0.3 and with 14.5 < u < 20.5. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in the u-band Petrosian aperture is improved by co-adding multiple epochs of imaging data and by including sky-subtraction corrections. Luminosity functions for the near-UV 0.1u band (lambda~ 322 +/- 26nm) are determined in redshift slices of width 0.02, which show a highly significant evolution in M* of -0.8 +/- 0.1 mag between z= 0 and 0.3; with M*-5 logh70=-18.84 +/- 0.05 (AB mag), logphi*=-2.06 +/- 0.03 (h370Mpc-3) and logrhoL= 19.11 +/- 0.02 (h70WHz-1Mpc-3) at z= 0.1. The faint-end slope determined for z < 0.06 is given by alpha=-1.05 +/- 0.08. This is in agreement with recent determinations from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer at shorter wavelengths. Comparing our z < 0.3 luminosity density measurements with 0.2 < z < 1.2 from Classifying Objects by Medium Band Observations in 17 Filters (COMBO-17), we find that the 280-nm density evolves as rhoL~ (1 +z)beta with beta= 2.1 +/- 0.2; and find no evidence for any change in slope over this redshift range. By comparing with other measurements of cosmic star formation history, we estimate that the effective dust attenuation at 280nm has increased by 0.8 +/- 0.3mag between z= 0 and 1.

AB  - We examine the relationship between environment and the luminosities, surface brightnesses, colors, and profile shapes of luminous galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For the SDSS sample, galaxy color is the galaxy property most predictive of the local environment. Galaxy color and luminosity-measures of the star formation history-jointly comprise the most predictive pair of properties. At fixed luminosity and color, density is not closely related to surface brightness or to Sérsic index-measures of galaxy structure. In the text, we discuss what measurable residual relationships exist, generally finding that at red colors and fixed luminosity, the mean density decreases at the highest surface brightnesses and Sérsic indices. In general, these results suggest that the structural properties of galaxies are less closely related to galaxy environment than are their masses and star formation histories.  Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

AB  - We present a statistical study of the environments of 63 high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) between redshifts 1 <= z <= 5.2, using the 24 mum waveband of the MIPS instrument aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. Using a counts-in-cell analysis, a statistically significant source overdensity is found in 1.75' radius circular cells centred on the HzRGs when compared to reference fields. We report an average overdensity of delta (=barN_targets / barN_reference) = 2.2 $\pm$ at a flux density cut of f24 mum = 0.3 mJy. This result implies that HzRGs are likely to lie in protoclusters of active and star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Over 95% of our targeted HzRGs lie in higher than average density fields. Further, 20 (32%) of our selected fields are found to be overdense to at least a 3sigma significance, of which 9 are newly identified protocluster candidates. We observe a weak correlation between redshift and 24 mum source density, and discuss the populations being probed at different redshifts. In our uniformly selected sample, which was designed to cover two orders of magnitude in radio luminosity throughout z = 1-4, we find that the 24 mum source density does not depend on radio luminosity. We also compare this result with recent work describing IRAC source overdensities around the same HzRGs and find correlations between the results.

AB  - We revisit the concept of a blazar sequence that relates the synchrotron peak frequency (nupeak) in blazars with synchrotron peak luminosity (L peak, in nuL nu) using a large sample of radio-loud active galactic nuclei. We present observational evidence that the blazar sequence is formed from two populations in the synchrotron nupeak-L peak plane, each forming an upper edge to an envelope of progressively misaligned blazars, and connecting to an adjacent group of radio galaxies having jets viewed at much larger angles to the line of sight. When binned by jet kinetic power (L kin; as measured through a scaling relationship with extended radio power), we find that radio core dominance decreases with decreasing synchrotron L peak, revealing that sources in the envelope are generally more misaligned. We find population-based evidence of velocity gradients in jets at low kinetic powers (~1042-1044.5 erg s-1), corresponding to Fanaroff-Riley (FR) I radio galaxies and most BL Lac objects. These low jet power "weak-jet" sources, thought to exhibit radiatively inefficient accretion, are distinguished from the population of non-decelerating, low synchrotron-peaking (LSP) blazars and FR II radio galaxies ("strong" jets) which are thought to exhibit radiatively efficient accretion. The two-population interpretation explains the apparent contradiction of the existence of highly core-dominated, low-power blazars at both low and high synchrotron peak frequencies, and further implies that most intermediate synchrotron peak sources are not intermediate in intrinsic jet power between LSP and high synchrotron-peaking (HSP) sources, but are more misaligned versions of HSP sources with similar jet powers.

AB  - Context. Properties of galaxies depend on their large-scale environment. As the influence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy evolution is becoming more evident, their large-scale environments may help us understand the evolutionary processes leading to activity. The effect of activity can be seen particularly by showing whether different types of active galaxies are formed by similar mechanisms.  Aims: Our aim is to study the supercluster-scale environments of active galaxies up to redshift 0.4. Our data include quasars, BL Lac objects, Seyfert, and radio galaxies.  Methods: We used a three-dimensional, low-resolution luminosity-density field constructed of a sample of luminous red galaxies in the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We calculated the average density of this field in a volume of a 3 h-1 Mpc sphere around each AGN for estimating the environmental density levels of different types of AGN. This analysis gives us the distribution of AGN in the global environment of superclusters, filaments, and voids.  Results: Our results show that, while radio-quiet quasars and Seyfert galaxies are mostly located in low-density regions, radio galaxies have higher environmental densities. BL Lac objects usually have low-density environments, but some of them are also in very high-density regions.  Conclusions: Our results give support to the theory of galaxy evolution where galaxies are affected by two modes of AGN feedback: quasar mode that turns a blue star-forming galaxy into a red and dead one, and radio mode that regulates the growth of massive elliptical galaxies. We conclude that quasars are in lower density environments than radio galaxies, most likely because the galaxies in rich environments have evolved to a state suitable for radio-loud activity earlier. Galaxies in poor environment have evolved more slowly, and are still going through the earlier quasar-mode feedback in galaxy evolution.

AB  - We propose a scenario where blazars are classified into flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects, low-synchrotron, or high-synchrotron peaked objects according to a varying mix of the Doppler-boosted radiation from the jet, the emission from the accretion disc, the broad-line region, and the light from the host galaxy. In this framework, the peak energy of the synchrotron power (?) in blazars is independent of source type and radio luminosity. We test this new approach, which builds upon unified schemes, using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, and show that it can provide simple answers to a number of long-standing issues, including, amongst others, the different cosmological evolution of BL Lac objects selected in the radio and X-ray bands, the larger ? values observed in BL Lac objects, the fact that high-synchrotron peaked blazars are always of BL Lac type, and the existence of FSRQ-BL Lac transition objects. Objects so far classified as BL Lac objects on the basis of their observed weak, or undetectable, emission lines are of two physically different classes: intrinsically weak lined objects, more common in X-ray-selected samples, and heavily diluted broad-lined sources, more frequent in radio-selected samples, which explains some of the confusion in the literature. We also show that strong selection effects are the main cause of the diversity observed in radio and X-ray samples, and that the correlation between luminosity and ?, which led to the proposal of the 'blazar sequence', is also a selection effect arising from the comparison between shallow radio and X-ray surveys, and to the fact that high-?-high-radio-power objects have never been considered because their redshift is not measurable.

AB  - Taking advantage of the impressive sensitivity of Spitzer to detect massive galaxies at high redshift, we study the mid-infrared environments of powerful, high-redshift radio galaxies at 1.2 < z < 3. Galaxy cluster member candidates were isolated using a single Spitzer/IRAC mid-infrared color criterion, [3.6]-[4.5] > -0.1 (AB), in the fields of 48 radio galaxies at 1.2 < z < 3. Using a counts-in-cell analysis, we identify a field as overdense when 15 or more red IRAC sources are found within 1' (i.e., 0.5 Mpc at 1.2 < z < 3) of the radio galaxy to the 5sigma flux density limits of our IRAC data (f 4.5 = 13.4 muJy). We find that radio galaxies lie preferentially in medium to dense regions, with 73% of the targeted fields denser than average. Our (shallow) 120 s data permit the rediscovery of previously known clusters and protoclusters associated with radio galaxies as well as the discovery of new promising galaxy cluster candidates at z > 1.2.

AB  - Building on the legacy of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-I and II), SDSS-III is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific themes: dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and structure of the Milky Way, and the population of giant planets around other stars. In keeping with SDSS tradition, SDSS-III will provide regular public releases of all its data, beginning with SDSS Data Release 8 (DR8), which was made public in 2011 January and includes SDSS-I and SDSS-II images and spectra reprocessed with the latest pipelines and calibrations produced for the SDSS-III investigations. This paper presents an overview of the four surveys that comprise SDSS-III. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey will measure redshifts of 1.5 million massive galaxies and Lyalpha forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using the baryon acoustic oscillation feature of large-scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations of the distance scale and Hubble expansion rate at z < 0.7 and at z ≈ 2.5. SEGUE-2, an already completed SDSS-III survey that is the continuation of the SDSS-II Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE), measured medium-resolution (R = lambda/Deltalambda ≈ 1800) optical spectra of 118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution, stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matter halo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. APOGEE, the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment, will obtain high-resolution (R ≈ 30,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N >= 100 per resolution element), H-band (1.51 mum < lambda < 1.70 mum) spectra of 105 evolved, late-type stars, measuring separate abundances for ~15 elements per star and creating the first high-precision spectroscopic survey of all Galactic stellar populations (bulge, bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectral diagnostics. The Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS) will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 FGK stars with the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m s-1, ~24 visits per star) needed to detect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an unprecedented data set for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. As of 2011 January, SDSS-III has obtained spectra of more than 240,000 galaxies, 29,000 z >= 2.2 quasars, and 140,000 stars, including 74,000 velocity measurements of 2580 stars for MARVELS.

AB  - Gas-rich disks in the early universe are highly turbulent and have giant star-forming clumps. Models suggest that the clumps form by gravitational instabilities, and if they resist disruption by star formation, then they interact, lose angular momentum, and migrate to the center to form a bulge. Here we study the properties of the bulges formed by this mechanism. They are all thick, slowly rotating, and have a high Sersic index, like classical bulges. Their rapid formation should also give them relatively high alpha-element abundances. We consider fourteen low-resolution models and four high-resolution models, three of which have supernova feedback. All models have an active halo, stellar disk, and gaseous disk; three of the models have a pre-existing bulge, and three others have a cuspy dark matter halo. All show the same basic result except the one with the highest feedback, in which the clumps are quickly destroyed and the disk thickens too much. The coalescence of massive disk clumps in the center of a galaxy is like a major merger in terms of orbital mixing. It differs by leaving a bulge with no specific dark matter component, unlike the merger of individual galaxies. Normal supernova feedback has little effect, because the high turbulent speed in the gas produces tightly bound clumps. A variety of indirect observations support the model, including clumpy disks with young bulges at high redshift and bulges with relatively little dark matter.

As VHE astronomy continues to grow, the usefulness of a one-stop clearing house for information on new sources is increasingly evident. TeVCat is intended to be such a resource. With sky maps, scientific information, visibility plotters, an interface with Google Earth "Sky", linked references and a review paper section, TeVCat enables the world-wide astrophysical community to stay up-to-date and informed on this exciting and rapidly developing field.

AB  - We present multi-wavelength radio observations in the direction of the spiral galaxy IC 2497 and the neighbouring emission nebula known as ``Hanny's Voorwerp''. Our WSRT continuum observations at 1.4 GHz and 4.9 GHz reveal the presence of extended emission at the position of the nebulosity, although the bulk of the emission remains unresolved at the centre of the galaxy. e-VLBI 1.65 GHz observations show that on the milliarcsecond-scale, a faint central compact source is present in IC 2497 with a brightness temperature in excess of 4 × 10^5 K. With the WSRT, we detect a large reservoir of neutral hydrogen in the proximity of IC 2497. One cloud complex with a total mass of 5.6 × 10^9 M_&sun; to the South of IC 2497 encompasses Hanny's Voorwerp. Another cloud complex is located at the position of a small galaxy group ˜100 kpc to the West of IC 2497 with a mass of 2.9 × 10^9 M_&sun;. Our data hint at a physical connection between the complexes. We also detect H I in absorption against the central continuum source of IC 2497. Our observations strongly support the hypothesis that Hanny's Voorwerp is being ionised by an AGN in the centre of IC 2497. In this scenario, a plasma jet associated with the AGN clears a path through the ISM/IGM in the direction of the nebulosity. The large-scale radio continuum emission possibly originates from the interaction between this jet and the large cloud complex in which Hanny's Voorwerp is embedded. The H I kinematics do not fit regular rotation, thus the cloud complex around IC 2497 is probably of tidal origin. From the H I absorption against the central source, we derive a lower limit of 2.8 $\pm$ 0.4 × 1021 atoms cm-2 to the H I column density. However, assuming non-standard conditions for the detected gas, we cannot exclude the possibility that the AGN in the centre of IC 2497 is Compton-thick.

AB  - We examine the fraction of early-type (and spiral) galaxies found in groups and clusters of galaxies as a function of dark matter halo mass. We use morphological classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project matched to halo masses from both the C4 cluster catalogue and the Yang et al. group catalogue. We find that the fraction of early-type (or spiral) galaxies remains constant (changing by less than 10 per cent) over three orders of magnitude in halo mass (13 <= log MH/h-1 M&sun;<= 15.8). This result is insensitive to our choice of halo mass measure, from velocity dispersions or summed optical luminosity. Furthermore, we consider the morphology-halo mass relations in bins of galaxy stellar mass M*, and find that while the trend of constant fraction remains unchanged, the early-type fraction amongst the most massive galaxies (11 <= log M*/h-1 M&sun;<= 12) is a factor of 3 greater than lower mass galaxies (10 <= log M*/h-1 M&sun;<= 10.7). We compare our observational results with those of simulations presented in De Lucia et al., as well as previous observational analyses and semi-analytic bulge (or disc) dominated galaxies from the Millennium Simulation. We find the simulations recover similar trends as observed, but may overpredict the abundances of the most massive bulge-dominated (early-type) galaxies. Our results suggest that most morphological transformation is happening on the group scale before groups merge into massive clusters. However, we show that within each halo a morphology-density relation remains: it is summing the total fraction to a self-similar scaled radius which results in a flat morphology-halo mass relationship.

AB  - We present an analysis of bar length measurements of 3150 local galaxies in a volume-limited sample of low-redshift (z < 0.06) disc galaxies. Barred galaxies were initially selected from the Galaxy Zoo 2 project, and the lengths and widths of the bars were manually drawn by members of the Galaxy Zoo community using a Google Maps interface. Bars were measured independently by different observers, multiple times per galaxy (>=3), and we find that observers were able to reproduce their own bar lengths to 3 per cent and each others' to better than 20 per cent. We find a colour bimodality in our disc galaxy population with bar length, i.e. longer bars inhabit redder disc galaxies and the bars themselves are redder, and that the bluest galaxies host the smallest galactic bars (<5 h-1 kpc). We also find that bar and disc colours are clearly correlated, and for galaxies with small bars, the disc is, on average, redder than the bar colours, while for longer bars the bar then itself is redder, on average, than the disc. We further find that galaxies with a prominent bulge are more likely to host longer bars than those without bulges. We categorize our galaxy populations by how the bar and/or ring are connected to the spiral arms. We find that galaxies whose bars are directly connected to the spiral arms are preferentially bluer and that these galaxies host typically shorter bars. Within the scatter, we find that stronger bars are found in galaxies which host a ring (and only a ring). The bar length and width measurements used herein are made publicly available for others to use (). This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 200 000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. Their contributions are individually acknowledged at .

AB  - Aims: The EFIGI catalogue of 4458 galaxies extracted from the PGC and SDSS DR4 was designed to provide a multiwavelength reference database of the morphological properties of nearby galaxies. The sample is limited in apparent diameter and densely samples all RC3 Hubble types.  Methods: We examine the statistics of the 16 EFIGI shape attributes, describing the various dynamical components, the texture, and the contamination by the environment of each galaxy. Using the redshifts from SDSS, HyperLeda, or NED for 99.53% of EFIGI galaxies, we derive estimates of absolute major isophotal diameters and the corresponding mean surface brightness in the SDSS g-band.  Results: We study the variations of the EFIGI morphological attributes with Hubble type and confirm that the visual Hubble sequence is a decreasing sequence of bulge-to-total ratio and an increasing sequence of disk contribution to the total galaxy flux. There is, nevertheless, a total spread of approximately five types for a given bulge-to-total ratio, because the Hubble sequence is primarily based on the strength and pitch angle of the spiral arms, independently from the bulge-to-total ratio. A steep decrease in the presence of dust from Sb to Sbc-Sc types appears to produce the grand spiral design of the Sc galaxies. In contrast, the scattered and giant HII regions show different strength variation patterns, with peaks for types Scd and Sm; hence, they do not appear to directly participate in the establishment of the visual Hubble sequence. The distortions from a symmetric profile also incidentally increase along the sequence. Bars and inner rings are frequent and occur in 41% and 25% of the disk galaxies respectively. Outer rings are half as frequent than inner rings, and outer pseudo-rings occur in 11% of barred galaxies. Finally, we find a smooth decrease in mean surface brightness and intrinsic size along the Hubble sequence. The largest galaxies are cD, ellipticals and Sab-Sbc intermediate spirals (20-50 kpc in D25), whereas Sd and later spirals are nearly half as big. S0 are intermediate in size (15-35 kpc in D25), and irregulars, compact and dwarf ellipticals are confirmed as small objects (5-15 kpc in D25). Dwarf spiral galaxies of type Sa to Scd are rare in the EFIGI catalogue, we only find two such objects.  Conclusions: The EFIGI sample provides us for the first time with a quantitative description of the visual Hubble sequence in terms of the specific morphological features of the various galaxy types.

AB  - Encoded within the morphological structure of galaxies are clues related to their formation and evolutionary history. Recent advances pertaining to the statistics of galaxy morphology include sophisticated measures of concentration (C), asymmetry (A) and clumpiness (S). In this study, these three parameters (CAS) have been applied to a suite of simulated galaxies and compared with observational results inferred from a sample of nearby galaxies. The simulations span a range of late-type systems, with masses between ˜1010 and ˜1012 M&sun;, and employ star formation density thresholds between 0.1 and 100 cm-3. We have found that the simulated galaxies possess comparable concentrations to their observed counterparts. However, the results of the CAS analysis revealed that the simulated galaxies are generally more asymmetric, and that the range of clumpiness values extends beyond the range of those observed. Strong correlations were obtained between the three CAS parameters and colour (B - V), consistent with observed galaxies. Furthermore, the simulated galaxies possess strong links between their CAS parameters and Hubble type, mostly in-line with their observed counterparts.

AB  - Low luminosity radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) are generally found in massive red elliptical galaxies, where they are thought to be powered through gas accretion from their surrounding hot halos in a radiatively inefficient manner. These AGN are often referred to as "low-excitation" radio galaxies (LERGs). When radio-loud AGN are found in galaxies with a young stellar population and active star formation, they are usually high-power radiatively-efficient radio AGN ("high-excitation", HERG). Using a sample of low-redshift radio galaxies identified within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we determine the fraction of galaxies that host a radio-loud AGN, fRL, as a function of host galaxy stellar mass, M*, star formation rate, color (defined by the 4000 Å break strength), radio luminosity and excitation state (HERG/LERG). We find the following: 1. LERGs are predominantly found in red galaxies. 2. The radio-loud AGN fraction of LERGs hosted by galaxies of any color follows a fLE_RL ∝ M^2.5_* power law. 3. The fraction of red galaxies hosting a LERG decreases strongly for increasing radio luminosity. For massive blue galaxies this is not the case. 4. The fraction of green galaxies hosting a LERG is lower than that of either red or blue galaxies, at all radio luminosities. 5. The radio-loud AGN fraction of HERGs hosted by galaxies of any color follows a fLE_RL ∝ M^1.5_* power law. 6. HERGs have a strong preference to be hosted by green or blue galaxies. 7. The fraction of galaxies hosting a HERG shows only a weak dependence on radio luminosity cut. 8. For both HERGs and LERGs, the hosting probability of blue galaxies shows a strong dependence on star formation rate. This is not observed in galaxies of a different color. Our interpretation of these results is that the presence of cold gas in a LERG enhances the probability that its SMBH becomes a luminous radio-loud AGN compared to the typical "model" LERG in a red elliptical galaxy. If enough cold gas can be transported to the SMBH a HERG can be created. However, the presence of cold gas does not automatically imply a HERG will be created. We speculate that feedback of the enhanced AGN activity in blue galaxies is responsible for the reduced probability of green galaxies to host a LERG.

AB  - Context: Bars are very common in the centre of the disc galaxies, and they drive the evolution of their structure. The state-of-the-art imaging and redshift surveys of galaxies allow us to study the relationships between the properties of the bars and those of their hosts in statistically significant samples.  Aims: A volume-limited sample of 2106 disc galaxies was studied to derive the bar fraction, length, and strength as a function of the morphology, size, local galaxy density, light concentration, and colour of the host galaxy. The sample galaxies were selected to not be strongly disturbed/interacting. Methods: The bar and galaxy properties were obtained by analysing the r-band images of the sample galaxies available in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5.  Results: The bars were detected using the ellipse fitting method and Fourier analysis method. They were tested and calibrated with extensive simulations on artificial images. The ellipse fitting method was found to be more efficient in detecting bars in spiral galaxies. The fraction of barred galaxies turned out to be 45%. A bar was found in 29% of the lenticular galaxies, in 55% and 54% of the early- and late-type spirals, respectively. The bar length (normalised by the galaxy size) of late-type spirals is shorter than in early-type or lenticular ones. A correlation between the bar length and galaxy size was found with longer bars hosted by larger galaxies. The bars of the lenticular galaxies are weaker than those in spirals. Moreover, the unimodal distribution of the bar strength found for all the galaxy types argues against a quick transition between the barred and unbarred statues. There is no difference between the local galaxy density of barred and unbarred galaxies. Besides, neither the length nor strength of the bars are correlated with the local density of the galaxy neighbourhoods. In contrast, a statistical significant difference between the central light concentration and colour of barred and unbarred galaxies was found. Bars are mostly located in less concentrated and bluer galaxies.  Conclusions: These results indicate that the properties of bars are strongly related to those of their host galaxies, but do not depend on the local environment.

AB  - We present a study of large-scale bars in the local universe, based on a large sample of 3692 galaxies, with 18.5<=Mg<-22.0 mag and redshift 0.01<=z<0.03, drawn from the Sloan Digitized Sky Survey. Our sample includes many galaxies that are disk-dominated and of late Hubble types. Both color cuts and Sérsic cuts yield a similar sample of ~2000 disk galaxies. We characterize bars and disks by ellipse-fitting r-band images and applying quantitative criteria. After excluding highly inclined (60$\,^\circ$) systems, we find the following results. (1) The optical r-band fraction (fopt-r) of barred galaxies, when averaged over the whole sample, is ~48%-52%. (2) When galaxies are separated according to half light radius (re), or normalized re/R24, which is a measure of the bulge-to-disk (B/D) ratio, a remarkable result is seen: fopt-r rises sharply, from ~40% in galaxies that have small re/R24 and visually appear to host prominent bulges, to ~70% for galaxies that have large re/R24 and appear disk-dominated. (3) For galaxies with bluer colors, fopt-r rises significantly (by ~30%). A weaker rise (by ~15%-20%) is seen for lower luminosities or lower masses. (4) While hierarchical LambdaCDM models of galaxy evolution models fail to produce galaxies without classical bulges, our study finds that ~20% of disk galaxies appear to be ``quasi-bulgeless.'' (5) We outline how the effect of a decreasing resolution and a rising obscuration of bars by gas and dust over z=0.2-1.0 can cause a significant artificial loss of bars, and an artificial reduction in the optical bar fraction over z=0.2-1.0.

AB  - A new sample of very powerful radio galaxies is defined from the Molonglo Reference Catalogue, according to the criteria S408MHz>5Jy, -30 deg<=delta<=10 deg and |b|>=10 deg. The sample is selected to have similar properties to the northern 3CR revised sample, and to be visible to a combination of existing northern telescopes such as the Very Large Array radio interferometer and large southern hemisphere telescope facilities. The sample contains 178 sources, of which spectroscopic redshifts are available in the literature for 128. For the remaining 50 sources, new radio imaging, optical imaging and spectroscopic observations are presented to identify the host galaxies and determine their redshifts. With these new observations the total sample is 100per cent optically identified and redshifts are available for 174 (98per cent) of the sources. The sample consists of one starburst galaxy, one Seyfert galaxy, 127 radio galaxies and 49 quasars. Basic properties of the sample, such as the distributions of the quasar and radio-galaxy populations in redshift and their locations on the radio power versus linear size (P-D) diagram, show no significant differences from the revised 3CR sample. The equatorial location and the high spectroscopic completeness of this sample make it a valuable resource for detailed studies of the nature and environments of these important objects with the new generation of southern hemisphere telescopes.

AB  - About one fifth of all spiral disk galaxies include a ring-shaped pattern in the light distribution, and an additional one third appear to have broken or partial rings made up of spiral arms (pseudorings). These rings are a special problem in galaxy morphology with a direct bearing on the internal dynamics and evolution of disk galaxies. Morphological data have shown that rings are most often associated with bars or other common nonaxisymmetric perturbations, such as ovals. Kinematic and metric data have provided considerable evidence for intrinsic oval shapes and preferred alignments between ring major axes and bars. Photometric data have demonstrated that most rings are sites of current active star formation, and in some galaxies a ring is the only place where recent star formation is found. A few rings are sites of the most spectacular "starbursts" known in non-violently interacting galaxies. Though a small fraction of observed rings may be due to collisions or mergers of galaxies, or to accretion of intergalactic gas, the vast majority of rings are probably simple resonance phenomena, caused by the actions of a rotating bar or other nonaxisymmetic disturbance on the motions of gas clouds in the disk. The evidence in support of this idea has accumulated steadily during the past 15 years, and our goal in this review is to bring together a large body of theoretical and observational results in one place. We shall see that rings are a natural consequence of barred galaxy dynamics, and that they are more easily understood than the bars and ovals which undoubtedly create them. However, there are interesting problems, such as the lack of any rings in some barred galaxies, the less common but by no means rare cases of rings in nonbarred galaxies, the role of mild tidal interactions, where the gas that fuels star formation in rings actually comes from, the existence of different ring types of very different time-scales in the same galaxy. We will discuss these problems in some detail here, and indicated where the solutions may lie.

AB  - Galaxy Zoo is the first study of nearby galaxies that contains reliable information about the spiral sense of rotation of galaxy arms for a sizeable number of galaxies. We measure the correlation function of spin chirality (the sense in which galaxies appear to be spinning) of face-on spiral galaxies in angular, real and projected spaces. Our results indicate a hint of positive correlation at separations less than ~0.5 Mpc at a statistical significance of 2sigma-3sigma. This is the first experimental evidence for chiral correlation of spins. Within the tidal torque theory, it indicates that the inertia tensors of nearby galaxies are correlated. This is complementary to the studies of nearby spin axis correlations that probe the correlations of the tidal field. Theoretical interpretation is made difficult by the small distances at which the correlations are detected, implying that substructure might play a significant role, and our necessary selection of face-on spiral galaxies, rather than a general volume-limited sample.  This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 100000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project.

AB  - The current generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), including the H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS telescope arrays, have made substantial contributions to our knowledge about the structure and composition of the highly relativistic jets from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, we discuss some of the outstanding scientific questions and give a qualitative overview of AGN related science topics which will be explored with the next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). CTA is expected to further constrain the structure and make-up of jets, and thus, to constrain models of jet formation, acceleration, and collimation. Furthermore, being the brightest well-established extragalactic sources of TeV \gamma- rays, AGNs can be used to probe the EBL, intergalactic magnetic fields, and the validity of the Lorentz Invariance principle at high photon energies.

AB  - We have examined the luminosity-size relationship as a function of environment for 12,150 Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies with precise visual classifications from the catalog of Nair & Abraham. Our analysis is subdivided into investigations of early-type galaxies and late-type galaxies. Early-type galaxies reveal a surprisingly tight luminosity-size relation. The dispersion in luminosity about the fiducial relation is only ~0.14 dex (0.35 mag), even though the sample contains galaxies that differ by a factor of almost 100 in luminosity. The dispersion about the luminosity-size relation is comparable to the dispersion about the fundamental plane, even though the luminosity-size relation is fundamentally simpler and computed using purely photometric parameters. We attribute this to using a clean sample of elliptical galaxies and a large Petrosian size measure, implying that the fundamental plane may closely resemble a fundamental line, provided a different (and arguably better) size measurement is adopted. The key contributors to the dispersion about the luminosity-size relation are found to be color and central concentration expanding our analysis to the full range of morphological types, we show that the slope, zero point, and scatter about the luminosity-size relation are independent of environmental density. Our study thus indicates that whatever process is building galaxies is doing so in a way that preserves fundamental scaling laws even as the typical luminosity of galaxies changes with environment. However, the distribution of galaxies along the luminosity-size relation is found to be strongly dependent on galaxy environment. This variation is in the sense that, at a given morphology, larger and more luminous galaxies are rarer in sparser environments. Our analysis of late-type galaxy morphologies reveals that scatter increases toward later Hubble types. Taken together, these results place strong constraints on conventional hierarchical models in which galaxies are built up in an essentially stochastic way.

AB  - We investigate the stellar masses of strongly barred spiral galaxies. Our analysis is based on a sample of ~14,000 visually classified nearby galaxies given by Nair & Abraham. The fraction of barred spiral galaxies is found to be a strong function of stellar mass and star formation history, with a minimum near the characteristic mass at which bimodality is seen in the stellar populations of galaxies. We also find that bar fractions are very sensitive to the central concentration of galaxies below the transition mass but not above it. This suggests that whatever process is causing the creation of the red and blue sequences is either influencing, or being influenced by, structural changes which manifest themselves in the absence of bars. As a consequence of strong bar fractions being sensitive to the mass range probed, our analysis helps resolve discrepant results on the reported evolution of bar fractions with redshift.

AB  - A major problem in extragalactic astronomy is the inability to distinguish in a robust, physical, and model-independent way how galaxy populations are physically related to each other and to their formation histories. A similar, but distinct, and also long-standing question is whether the structural appearances of galaxies, as seen through their stellar light distributions, contain enough physical information to offer this classification. We argue through the use of 240 images of nearby galaxies that three model-independent parameters measured on a single galaxy image reveal its major ongoing and past formation modes and can be used as a robust classification system. These parameters quantitatively measure: the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and clumpiness (S) of a galaxy's stellar light distribution. When combined into a three-dimensional ``CAS'' volume all major classes of galaxies in various phases of evolution are cleanly distinguished. We argue that these three parameters correlate with important modes of galaxy evolution: star formation and major merging activity. This is argued through the strong correlation of Halpha equivalent width and broadband colors with the clumpiness parameter S, the uniquely large asymmetries of 66 galaxies undergoing mergers, and the correlation of bulge to total light ratios, and stellar masses, with the concentration index. As an obvious goal is to use this system at high redshifts to trace evolution, we demonstrate that these parameters can be measured, within a reasonable and quantifiable uncertainty with available data out to z~3 using the Hubble Space Telescope GOODS ACS and Hubble Deep Field images.

AB  - We present in this paper a new three-dimensional galaxy classification system designed to account for the diversity of galaxy properties in the nearby universe. To construct this system we statistically analyse a sample of >22000 galaxies at v < 15000 km s-1 (z < 0.05) with Spearman rank and principal-component analyses (PCAs). Fourteen major galaxy properties are considered, including: Hubble type, size, colour, surface brightness, magnitude, stellar mass, internal velocities, HI gas content and an index that measures dynamical disturbances. We find, to a high degree, that most galaxy properties are correlated, with in particular Hubble type, colour and stellar mass all strongly related. We argue that this tight three-way correlation is a result of evolutionary processes that depend on galaxy mass, as we show that the relation between colour and mass is independent of Hubble type. Various PCAs reveal that most of the variation in nearby galaxy properties can be accounted for by eigenvectors dominated by (i) the scale of a galaxy, such as its stellar mass, (ii) the spectral type and (iii) the degree of dynamical disturbances. We suggest that these three properties: mass, star formation and interactions/mergers are the major features that determine a galaxy's physical state, and should be used to classify galaxies. As shown by Conselice et al., these properties are measurable within the CAS (concentration, asymmetry, clumpiness) structural system, thus providing an efficient mechanism for classifying galaxies in optical light within a physical meaningful framework. We furthermore discuss the fraction and number density of galaxies in the nearby universe as a function of Hubble type, for comparison with higher redshift populations.

AB  - We present two new nonparametric methods for quantifying galaxy morphology: the relative distribution of the galaxy pixel flux values (the Gini coefficient or G) and the second-order moment of the brightest 20% of the galaxy's flux (M20). We test the robustness of G and M20 to decreasing signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and spatial resolution and find that both measures are reliable to within 10% for images with average S/N per pixel greater than 2 and resolutions better than 1000 and 500 pc, respectively. We have measured G and M20, as well as concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and clumpiness (S) in the rest-frame near-ultraviolet/optical wavelengths for 148 bright local ``normal'' Hubble-type galaxies (E-Sd) galaxies, 22 dwarf irregulars, and 73 0.05<z<0.25 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). We find that most local galaxies follow a tight sequence in G-M20-C, where early types have high G and C and low M20 and late-type spirals have lower G and C and higher M20. The majority of ULIRGs lie above the normal galaxy G-M20 sequence because of their high G and M20 values. Their high Gini coefficients arise from very bright nuclei, while the high second-order moments are produced by multiple nuclei and bright tidal tails. All of these features are signatures of recent and on-going mergers and interactions. We also find that in combination with A and S, G is more effective than C at distinguishing ULIRGs from the ``normal'' Hubble types. Finally, we measure the morphologies of 491.7<z<3.8 galaxies from HST NICMOS observations of the Hubble Deep Field North. We find that many of the z~2 galaxies possess G and A higher than expected from degraded images of local elliptical and spiral galaxies and have morphologies more like low-redshift ULIRGs.

AB  - Context. Now that modern imaging surveys have produced large databases of galaxy images advanced morphological studies have become possible. This has driven the need for well-defined calibration samples.  Aims: We present the EFIGI catalogue, a multi-wavelength database specifically designed to densely sample all Hubble types. The catalogue merges data from standard surveys and catalogues (Principal Galaxy Catalogue, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Value-Added Galaxy Catalogue, HyperLeda, and the NASA Extragalactic Database) and provides detailed morphological information.  Methods: Imaging data were obtained from the SDSS DR4 in the u, g, r, i, and z bands for a sample of 4458 PGC galaxies, whereas photometric and spectroscopic data were obtained from the SDSS DR5 catalogue. Point-spread function models were derived in all five bands. Composite colour images of all objects were visually examined by a group of astronomers, and galaxies were assigned positions in the Hubble sequence and classified according to 16 morphological attributes describing their structure, texture, environment and appearance on a five-level scale.  Results: The EFIGI Hubble sequence is in remarkably good agreement with the RC3 Revised Hubble Sequence. The main characteristics and reliability of the catalogue are examined, including photometric completeness, type mix, systematic trends and correlations.  Conclusions: The final EFIGI database is a large sub-sample of the local Universe which densely samples Sd, Sdm, Sm and Im types compared to magnitude-limited catalogues. We estimate that the photometric catalogue is more than ≈ 80% complete for galaxies with 10< g < 14. More than 99.5% of EFIGI galaxies have known redshifts in the HyperLeda and NED databases.  EFIGI catalogue is available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/532/A74

AB  - We describe a modification of the usual definition of astronomical magnitudes, replacing the usual logarithm with an inverse hyperbolic sine function; we call these modified magnitudes ``asinh magnitudes.'' For objects detected at signal-to-noise ratios of greater than about 5, our modified definition is essentially identical to the traditional one; for fainter objects (including those with a formally negative flux), our definition is well behaved, tending to a definite value with finite errors as the flux goes to zero. This new definition is especially useful when considering the colors of faint objects, as the difference of two ``asinh'' magnitudes measures the usual flux ratio for bright objects, while avoiding the problems caused by dividing two very uncertain values for faint objects. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey data products will use this scheme to express all magnitudes in their catalogs.

AB  - We present a large sample of 803 star-forming luminous compact galaxies (LCGs) in the redshift range z = 0.02-0.63, selected from Data Release 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The global properties of these galaxies are similar to those of the so-called green pea star-forming galaxies in the redshift range z = 0.112-0.360 and selected from the SDSS on the basis of their green color and compact structure. In contrast to green pea galaxies, our LCGs are selected on the basis of both their spectroscopic and photometric properties, resulting in a ~10 times larger sample, with galaxies spanning a redshift range gsim2 times larger. We find that the oxygen abundances and the heavy element abundance ratios in LCGs do not differ from those of nearby low-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies. The median stellar mass of LCGs is ~109 M sun. However, for galaxies with high EW(Hbeta), >= 100 Å, it is only ~7 × 108 M sun. The star formation rate in LCGs varies in the large range of 0.7-60 M sun yr-1, with a median value of ~4 M sun yr-1, a factor of ~3 lower than in high-redshift star-forming galaxies at z >~ 3. The specific star formation rates in LCGs are extremely high and vary in the range ~10-9-10-7 yr-1, comparable to those derived in high-redshift galaxies.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - We present deep broadband imaging and long-slit spectroscopy of three compact, low-mass starburst galaxies at redshift z ~ 0.2-0.3, also referred to as Green Peas (GP). We measure physical properties of the ionized gas and derive abundances for several species with high precision. We find that the three GPs display relatively low extinction, low oxygen abundances, and remarkably high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios. We also report on the detection of clear signatures of Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars in these galaxies. We carry out a pilot spectral synthesis study using a combination of both population and evolutionary synthesis models. Their outputs are in qualitative agreement, strongly suggesting a formation history dominated by starbursts. In agreement with the presence of W-R stars, these models show that these GPs currently undergo a major starburst producing between ~4% and ~20% of their stellar mass. However, as models imply, they are old galaxies that formed most of their stellar mass several Gyr ago. The presence of old stars has been spectroscopically verified in one of the galaxies by the detection of Mg I lambdalambda5167, 5173 absorption lines. Additionally, we perform a surface photometry study based on Hubble Space Telescope data, which indicates that the three galaxies possess an exponential low surface brightness envelope. If due to stellar emission, the latter is structurally compatible with the evolved hosts of luminous blue compact dwarf (BCD)/H II galaxies, suggesting that GPs are identifiable with major episodes in the assembly history of local BCDs. These conclusions highlight the importance of these objects as laboratories for studying galaxy evolution at late cosmic epochs.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Green Peas are a new class of young, emission line galaxies that were discovered by citizen volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. Their low stellar mass, low metallicity, and very high star formation rates make Green Peas the nearby (z ~ 0.2) analogs of the Lyman break galaxies which account for the bulk of the star formation in the early universe (z ~ 2-5). They thus provide accessible laboratories in the nearby universe for understanding star formation, supernova feedback, particle acceleration, and magnetic field amplification in early galaxies. We report the first direct radio detection of Green Peas with low frequency Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations and our stacking detection with archival Very Large Array FIRST data. We show that the radio emission implies that these extremely young galaxies already have magnetic fields (gsim 30 muG) even larger than that of the Milky Way. This is at odds with the present understanding of magnetic field growth based on amplification of seed fields by dynamo action over a galaxy's lifetime. Our observations strongly favor models with pregalactic magnetic fields at muG levels.

AB  - The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, over the approximate redshift (z) range 8-1.5. It will image >250,000 distant galaxies using three separate cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope, from the mid-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and will find and measure Type Ia supernovae at z > 1.5 to test their accuracy as standardizable candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive ancillary data. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to a stellar mass of 109 M &sun; to z ≈ 2, reaching the knee of the ultraviolet luminosity function of galaxies to z ≈ 8. The survey covers approximately 800 arcmin2 and is divided into two parts. The CANDELS/Deep survey (5sigma point-source limit H = 27.7 mag) covers ~125 arcmin2 within Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N and GOODS-S. The CANDELS/Wide survey includes GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-deep Survey) and covers the full area to a 5sigma point-source limit of H >~ 27.0 mag. Together with the Hubble Ultra Deep Fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered "wedding-cake" approach that has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. Data from the survey are nonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science investigations. In this paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the CANDELS team science goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selection and geometry, and the observing design. The Hubble data processing and products are described in a companion paper.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - This paper describes the Hubble Space Telescope imaging data products and data reduction procedures for the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). This survey is designed to document the evolution of galaxies and black holes at z ≈ 1.5-8, and to study Type Ia supernovae at z > 1.5. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with extensive multi-wavelength observations. The primary CANDELS data consist of imaging obtained in the Wide Field Camera 3 infrared channel (WFC3/IR) and the WFC3 ultraviolet/optical channel, along with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The CANDELS/Deep survey covers ~125 arcmin2 within GOODS-N and GOODS-S, while the remainder consists of the CANDELS/Wide survey, achieving a total of ~800 arcmin2 across GOODS and three additional fields (Extended Groth Strip, COSMOS, and Ultra-Deep Survey). We summarize the observational aspects of the survey as motivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of the data reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reduction methods utilize the most up-to-date calibration files and image combination procedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range of instrumental effects, including charge transfer efficiency degradation for ACS, removal of electronic bias-striping present in ACS data after Servicing Mission 4, and persistence effects and other artifacts in WFC3/IR. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochs and eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry. A more detailed overview of the science goals and observational design of the survey are presented in a companion paper.

AB  - We present a catalog of morphologically classified bright galaxies in the north equatorial stripe (230 deg2) derived from the Third Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Morphological classification is performed by visual inspection of images in the g band. The catalog contains 2253 galaxies complete to a magnitude limit of r=16 after Galactic extinction correction, selected from 2658 objects that are judged to be extended in the photometric catalog in the same magnitude limit. A total of 1866 galaxies in our catalog have spectroscopic information. A brief statistical analysis is presented for the frequency of morphological types and mean colors in the catalog. A visual inspection of the images reveals that the rate of interacting galaxies in the local universe is approximately 1.5% in the r<=16 sample. A verification is made for the photometric catalog generated by the SDSS, especially as to its bright-end completeness.

AB  - We present a catalog of detailed visual classifications for 14,034 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 4 (DR4). Our sample includes nearly all spectroscopically targeted galaxies in the redshift range 0.01 < z < 0.1 down to an apparent extinction-corrected limit of g < 16 mag. In addition to T-Types, we record the existence of bars, rings, lenses, tails, warps, dust lanes, arm flocculence, and multiplicity. This sample defines a comprehensive local galaxy sample which we will use in future papers to study low-redshift morphology. It will also prove useful for calibrating automated galaxy classification algorithms. In this paper, we describe the classification methodology used, detail the systematics and biases of our sample, and summarize the overall statistical properties of the sample, noting the most obvious trends that are relevant for general comparisons of our catalog with previously published work.

AB  - This paper focuses on a comparison of the space densities of Fanaroff-Riley type I (FRI) and FRII sources at different epochs, with a particular focus on FRI sources.  First, we present the concluding steps in constructing the Combined NVSS-FIRST Galaxies (CoNFIG) catalogue, including new Very Large Array observations, optical identifications and redshift estimates. The final catalogue consists of 859 sources over four samples (CoNFIG-1, -2, -3 and -4 with flux density limits of S1.4GHz = 1.3, 0.8, 0.2 and 0.05Jy, respectively). It is 95.7 per cent complete in radio morphology classification and 74.3 per cent of the sources have redshift data.  Combining CoNFIG with complementary samples, the distribution and evolution of FRI and FRII sources are investigated. We find that FRI sources undergo mild evolution and that, at the same radio luminosity, FRI and FRII sources show similar space density enhancements in various redshift ranges, possibly implying a common evolution.

AB  - We present first results from Galaxy Zoo 2, the second phase of the highly successful Galaxy Zoo project (). Using a volume-limited sample of 13 665 disc galaxies (0.01 < z < 0.06 and Mr < -19.38), we study the fraction of galaxies with bars as a function of global galaxy properties like colour, luminosity and bulge prominence. Overall, 29.4 $\pm$ 0.5 per cent of galaxies in our sample have a bar, in excellent agreement with previous visually classified samples of galaxies (although this overall fraction is lower than that measured by automated bar-finding methods). We see a clear increase in the bar fraction with redder (g-r) colours, decreased luminosity and in galaxies with more prominent bulges, to the extent that over half of the red, bulge-dominated disc galaxies in our sample possess a bar. We see evidence for a colour bimodality for our sample of disc galaxies, with a 'red sequence' that is both bulge and bar dominated, and a 'blue cloud' which has little, or no, evidence for a (classical) bulge or bar. These results are consistent with similar trends for barred galaxies seen recently both locally and at higher redshift, and with early studies using the RC3. We discuss these results in the context of internal (secular) galaxy evolution scenarios and the possible links to the formation of bars and bulges in disc galaxies. This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 200 000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project.

AB  - We study the morphology and size of the luminous and massive galaxies at 0.3 < z < 0.7 targeted in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) using publicly available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and catalogues, from the COSMic Origins Survey (COSMOS). Our sample (240 objects) provides a unique opportunity to check the visual morphology of these galaxies which were targeted based solely on stellar population modelling. We find that the majority of BOSS galaxies (74 $\pm$ 6 per cent) possess an early-type morphology (elliptical or lenticular), while the remainder have a late-type (spiral disc) morphology. This is as expected from the goals of the BOSS target selection which aimed to predominantly select slowly evolving galaxies, for use as cosmological probes, while still obtaining a fair fraction of actively star-forming galaxies for galaxy evolution studies. We show that a colour cut of (g-i) > 2.35 is able to select a sub-sample of BOSS galaxies with >=90 per cent early-type morphology and thus more comparable to the earlier Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) samples of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-I/II. The remaining ~=10 per cent of galaxies above this (g-i) cut have a late-type morphology and may be analogous to the 'passive spirals' found at lower redshift. We find that 23 $\pm$ 4 per cent of the early-type BOSS galaxies are unresolved multiple systems in the SDSS imaging. We estimate that at least 50 per cent of these multiples are likely real associations and not projection effects and may represent a significant 'dry merger' fraction. We study the SDSS pipeline sizes of BOSS galaxies which we find to be systematically larger (by 40 per cent) than those measured from HST images, and provide a statistical correction for the difference. These details of the BOSS galaxies will help users of the BOSS data fine-tune their selection criteria, dependent on their science applications. For example, the main goal of BOSS is to measure the cosmic distance scale and expansion rate of the Universe to per cent level precision - a point where systematic effects due to the details of target selection may become important.

AB  - The all sky surveys done by the Palomar Observatory Schmidt, the European Southern Observatory Schmidt, and the United Kingdom Schmidt, the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey have proven to be extremely useful tools for astronomy with value that lasts for decades. The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is mapping the whole sky following its launch on 2009 December 14. WISE began surveying the sky on 2010 January 14 and completed its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted (anticipated in 2010 November). WISE is achieving 5sigma point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1, and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6farcs1, 6farcs4, 6farcs5, and 12farcs0 at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum, and the astrometric precision for high signal-to-noise sources is better than 0farcs15.

AB  - Blazars constitute the most interesting and enigmatic class of extragalactic gamma-ray sources dominated by non-thermal emission. In this Letter, we show how the Wide Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) infrared data make it possible to identify a distinct region of the [3.4]-[4.6]-[12] mum color-color diagram where the sources dominated by the thermal radiation are separated from those dominated by non-thermal emission, in particular the blazar population. This infrared non-thermal region, which we indicate as the WISE blazar strip (WBS), will constitute a new powerful diagnostic tool when the full WISE survey data are released. The WBS can be used to extract new blazar candidates, to identify those of uncertain type and also to search for the counterparts of unidentified gamma-ray sources. We show one example of the value of the use of the WBS identifying the TeV source VER J0648+152, recently discovered by VERITAS.

AB  - The Galaxy Zoo citizen science website invites anyone with an Internet connection to participate in research by classifying galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. As of April 2009, more than 200,000 volunteers had made more than 100 million galaxy classifications. In this paper, we present results of a pilot study into the motivations and demographics of Galaxy Zoo volunteers, and define a technique to determine motivations from free responses that can be used in larger multiple-choice surveys with similar populations. Our categories form the basis for a future survey, with the goal of determining the prevalence of each motivation.

AB  - A survey was made of typical galactic nuclei in a statistically complete sample of roughly 90 bright galaxies in order to detect compact nonthermal radio sources and emission-line regions not excited by normal stars. A class of Low Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions (Liners) occurring commonly in typical galactic nuclei is defined, whose principal characteristic is the relative strength of emission lines from species of low ionization state, and whose luminosity (L(H alpha) of about 10 to the 38th to 10 to the 40th ergs/s) is more similar to that of a typical giant H II region than to the Seyfert galaxies and QSOs. In addition, 13 Compact Nuclear Radio Sources (CNRS) have been detected in the sample; the presence and strength of a Liner is found to be statistically related to the presence and strength of a CNRS.

AB  - We have completed an optical spectroscopic survey of the nuclear regions (r <~ 200 pc) of a large sample of nearby galaxies. Although the main objectives of the survey are to search for low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and to quantify their luminosity function, the database can be used for a variety of other purposes. This paper presents measurements of the spectroscopic parameters for the 418 emission-line nuclei, along with a compilation of the global properties of all 486 galaxies in the survey. Stellar absorption generally poses a serious obstacle to obtaining accurate measurement of emission lines in nearby galactic nuclei. We describe a procedure for removing the starlight from the observed spectra in an efficient and objective manner. The main parameters of the emission lines (intensity ratios, fluxes, profile widths, and equivalent widths) are measured and tabulated, as are several stellar absorption-line and continuum indices useful for studying the stellar population. Using standard nebular diagnostics, we determine the probable ionization mechanisms of the emission-line objects. The resulting spectral classifications provide extensive information on the demographics of emission-line nuclei in the nearby regions of the universe. This new catalog contains over 200 objects showing spectroscopic evidence for recent star formation and an equally large number of active galactic nuclei, including 46 that show broad H alpha emission. These samples will serve as the basis of future studies of nuclear activity in nearby galaxies.

AB  - We use archival Hubble Space Telescope observations of resolved stellar populations to derive the star formation histories (SFHs) of 18 nearby starburst dwarf galaxies. In this first paper, we present the observations, color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and the SFHs of the 18 starburst galaxies, based on a homogeneous approach to the data reduction, differential extinction, and treatment of photometric completeness. We adopt a star formation rate (SFR) threshold normalized to the average SFR of the individual system as a metric for classifying starbursts in SFHs derived from resolved stellar populations. This choice facilitates finding not only the currently bursting galaxies but also "fossil" bursts increasing the sample size of starburst galaxies in the nearby (D < 8 Mpc) universe. Thirteen of the eighteen galaxies are experiencing ongoing bursts and five galaxies show fossil bursts. From our reconstructed SFHs, it is evident that the elevated SFRs of a burst are sustained for hundreds of Myr with variations on small timescales. A long >100 Myr temporal baseline is thus fundamental to any starburst definition or identification method. The longer lived bursts rule out rapid "self-quenching" of starbursts on global scales. The bursting galaxies' gas consumption timescales are shorter than the Hubble time for all but one galaxy confirming the short-lived nature of starbursts based on fuel limitations. Additionally, we find that the strength of the Halpha emission usually correlates with the CMD-based SFR during the last 4-10 Myr. However, in four cases, the Halpha emission is significantly less than what is expected for models of starbursts; the discrepancy is due to the SFR changing on timescales of a few Myr. The inherently short timescale of the Halpha emission limits identifying galaxies as starbursts based on the current characteristics which may or may not be representative of the recent SFH of a galaxy.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

AB  - Following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of the ionized gas in early-type galaxies, we now address the question of what is powering the observed nebular emission. To constrain the likely sources of gas excitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data we draw from complementary information on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potential from the SAURON data, and use the SAURON-specific diagnostic diagram juxtaposing the [OIII] lambda5007/Hbeta and [NI] lambdalambda5197, 5200/Hbeta line ratios. We find a tight correlation between the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the Hbeta recombination line across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as the main contributor of ionizing photons in early-type galaxies, with post-asymptotic giant branch (pAGB) stars being still the best candidate based on ionizing balance arguments. The role of AGN photoionization is confined to the central 2-3arcsec of an handful of objects with radio or X-ray cores. OB-stars are the dominant source of photoionization in 10 per cent of the SAURON sample, whereas for another 10 per cent the intense and highly ionized emission is powered by the pAGB population associated to a recently formed stellar subcomponent. Fast shocks are not an important source of ionization for the diffuse nebular emission of early-type galaxies since the required shock velocities can hardly be attained in the potential of our sample galaxies. Finally, in the most massive and slowly or non-rotating galaxies in our sample, which can retain a massive X-ray halo, the finding of a spatial correlation between the hot and warm phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) suggests that the interaction with the hot ISM provides an additional source of ionization besides old ultraviolet-bright stars. This is also supported by a distinct pattern towards lower values of the [OIII]/Hbeta ratio. These results lead us to investigate the relative role of stellar and AGN photoionization in explaining the ionized gas emission observed in early-type galaxies by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By simulating how our sample galaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the SDSS, we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the SDSS galaxies which display modest values for the equivalent width of the [OIII] line (less than ~2.4 Å) and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region like [OIII]/Hbeta values the nebular emission is truly powered by an AGN.

AB  - The transformations that take place in late-type galaxies in the environment of rich clusters of galaxies at z=0 are reviewed. From the handful of late-type galaxies that inhabit local clusters, whether they were formed in situ and survived as such, avoiding transformation or even destruction, or if they are newcomers that have recently fallen in from outside, we can learn an important lesson on the latest stages of galaxy evolution. We start by reviewing the observational scenario, covering the broadest possible stretch of the electromagnetic spectrum, from the gas tracers (radio and optical) to the star formation tracers (UV and optical), the old star tracers (near-IR), and the dust (far-IR). Strong emphasis is given to the three nearby, well-studied clusters Virgo, A1367, and Coma, which are representative of different evolutionary stages, from unrelaxed and spiral-rich (Virgo) to relaxed and spiral-poor (Coma). We continue by providing a review of models of galaxy interactions that are relevant to clusters of galaxies. Prototypes of various mechanisms and processes are discussed, and their typical timescales are given in an appendix. Observations indicate the presence of healthy late-type galaxies falling into nearby clusters individually or as part of massive groups. More rare are infalling galaxies belonging to compact groups, where significant preprocessing might take place. Once they have entered the cluster, they lose their gas and quench their star formation activity, becoming anemic. Observations and theory agree in indicating that the interaction with the intergalactic medium is responsible for the gas depletion. However, this process cannot be the origin of the cluster lenticular galaxy population. Physical and statistical properties of S0 galaxies in nearby clusters and at higher redshift indicate that they originate from spiral galaxies that have been transformed by gravitational interactions.

AB  - RS Ophiuchi is a recurrent nova system that experiences outbursts every ~20 years, implying accretion at a high rate onto a massive white dwarf. However, previous X-ray observations of the system in quiescence have detected only faint emission that is difficult to reconcile with the high accretion rate (>2 × 10-8 M sun yr-1) predicted by nova theory for such frequent outbursts. Here, we use new Chandra and XMM-Newton observations obtained 537 and 744 days after the 2006 outburst to constrain both the accretion rate onto the white dwarf and the properties of the nova ejecta at these times. We detect low level UV variability with the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor on day 744 that is consistent with accretion disk flickering, and use this to place a lower limit on the accretion rate at this epoch. The X-ray spectra in both observations are well described by a two component thermal plasma model. We identify the first component as the nova shell, which can emit X-rays for up to a decade after the outburst. The other component likely arises in the accretion disk boundary layer, and can be equally well fit by a single temperature plasma or a cooling flow model. Although the flux of the single temperature model implies an accretion rate that is 40 times too low to power the observed nova outburst rate (assuming that half of the accretion luminosity is emitted as X-rays in the boundary layer), the best-fit cooling flow model implies M < 1.2 × 10-8 M sun yr-1 537 days after the outburst, which is within a factor of two of the theoretical accretion rate required to power an outburst every 20 years. Furthermore, we place an upper limit on the accretion rate through an optically thick region of the boundary layer of 2.0 × 10-8 M sun yr-1. Thus, these new quiescence data are consistent with the accretion rate expectations of nova theory. Finally, we discuss the possible origins of the low temperature associated with the accretion component, which is a factor of 10 lower than in T CrB, an otherwise similar recurrent nova.

AB  - An investigation is made of the merits of various emission-line intensity ratios for classifying the spectra of extragalactic objects. It is shown empirically that several combinations of easily-measured lines can be used to separate objects into one of four categories according to the principal excitation mechanism: normal H II regions, planetary nebulae, objects photoionized by a power-law continuum, and objects excited by shock-wave heating. A two-dimensional quantitative classification scheme is suggested.

AB  - Powering the 1062 erg nuclear outburst in the MS0735.6+7421 cluster central galaxy by accretion with a 10% mass-to-energy conversion efficiency implies that its putative supermassive black hole (SMBH) grew by ~6 × 108 M sun over the past 100 Myr. Guided by data at several wavelengths, we place upper limits on the amount of cold gas and star formation near the nucleus of <109 M sun and <2 M sun yr-1, respectively. These limits imply that an implausibly large fraction of the preexisting cold gas in the inner several kpc must have been consumed by its SMBH at the rate of ~3-5 M sun yr-1 during the past 100 Myr while leaving no trace of star formation. Such a high accretion rate would be difficult to maintain by stellar accretion or the Bondi mechanism, unless the black hole mass approaches 1011 M sun. Furthermore, its feeble nuclear luminosities in the UV, I, and X-ray bands compared to its enormous mechanical power are inconsistent with rapid accretion onto a ~5 × 109 M sun black hole. We suggest instead that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) outburst is powered by angular momentum released from a rapidly spinning black hole. The rotational energy and power available from a spinning black hole are consistent with the cavity and shock energetics inferred from X-ray observations. A maximally spinning 109 M sun black hole contains enough rotational energy, ~1062 erg, to quench a cooling flow over its lifetime and to contribute significantly to the excess entropy found in the hot atmospheres of groups and clusters. Two modes of AGN feedback may be quenching star formation in elliptical galaxies centered in cooling halos at late times. An accretion mode that operates in gas-rich systems, and a spin mode operating at modest accretion rates. The spin conjecture may be avoided in MS0735 by appealing to Bondi accretion onto a central black hole whose mass greatly exceeds 1010 M sun. The host galaxy's unusually large 3.8 kpc stellar core radius (light deficit) may witness the presence of an ultramassive black hole.

AB  - A long-standing problem for models of galaxy formation has been the mismatch between the predicted shape of the mass function of dark matter halos and the observed shape of the luminosity function of galaxies. The number of massive haloes is predicted to decrease as a power law (N~M-2) out to very large masses, while the galaxy luminosity function cuts off exponentially at luminosities above L*. This implies that the efficiency with which gas cools onto massive systems is lower than expected. This letter investigates the role of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) in continually re-heating the cooling gas. By combining two observational results, the time-averaged energy output associated with recurrent radio source activity is determined, as a function of the black hole mass of the host galaxy: . It is shown that for massive elliptical galaxies this radio-source heating balances the radiative energy losses from the hot gas surrounding the galaxy. The recurrent radio-loud AGN activity may therefore provide a self-regulating feedback mechanism capable of controlling the rate of growth of galaxies.

AB  - In order to understand the formation and subsequent evolution of galaxies one must first distinguish between the two main morphological classes of massive systems: spirals and early-type systems. This paper introduces a project, Galaxy Zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly one million galaxies, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This achievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visually inspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. The project has obtained more than 4 × 107 individual classifications made by ~105 participants. We discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how the classifications were performed and processed. We find that Galaxy Zoo results are consistent with those for subsets of SDSS galaxies classified by professional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provide a robust morphological catalogue. Obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspection avoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such as colour, concentration or structural parameters. In addition, this catalogue can be used to directly compare SDSS morphologies with older data sets. The colour-magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and we illustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colour alone as a proxy for morphology.  This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 100000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project.

AB  - We have assembled a sample of 64 late-type spiral galaxies (T types 6.0-9.0, corresponding to Hubble types Scd-Sm) with archival Chandra data. At a signal-to-noise (S/N) threshold of 3, we find 12 objects with X-ray point-source detections in close proximity with the optical or near-infrared position of the nucleus (median offset delta = 1farcs6), suggestive of possible low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Including measurements with 3 > S/N > 1.5, our detections increase to 18. These X-ray sources range in luminosity from L X(2-10 keV) = 1037.1 to 1039.6 erg s-1. Considering possible contamination from low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), we estimate that ~5 detections are possible LMXBs instead of true AGNs, based on the probability of observing an LMXB in a nuclear star cluster (NC) typically found in these late-type spiral galaxies. Given the typical ages of NCs, contamination by high-mass X-ray binaries is unlikely. This AGN fraction is higher than that observed in optical surveys, indicating that active nuclei, and hence central black holes (BHs), are more common than previously suggested. The incidence of AGN activity in such late-type spiral galaxies also suggests that nuclear massive BHs can form and grow in galaxies with little or no evidence for bulges. Follow-up multiwavelength observations will be necessary to confirm the true nature of these sources.

AB  - We report preliminary results from an arcsecond-resolution X-ray survey of nearby galaxies using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer on board the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. The total sample consists of 41 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including Seyfert galaxies, LINERs, and LINER/H II transition objects. In the initial subsample of 24 objects observed thus far, we detect in ~62% of the objects a compact, pointlike source astrometrically coincident with either the optical or radio position of the nucleus. The high detection rate strongly suggests that the majority of the objects do contain weakly active, AGN-like cores, presumably powered by central massive black holes. The 2-10 keV luminosities of the nuclear sources range from less than 1038 to 1041 ergs s-1, with a median value of 2×1038 ergs s-1. Our detection limit corresponds to LX(2-10 keV)~8×1037 ergs s-1 for the typical sample distance of 12 Mpc; this limit is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than the weakest sources of this kind previously studied using ASCA or BeppoSAX. The new data extend toward lower luminosities the known linear correlation between hard X-ray and Halpha luminosity for broad-line AGNs. Many narrow-line objects do contain X-ray cores, consistent with either weak AGNs or X-ray binary systems, but they have X-ray luminosities a factor of 10 below the LX-LHalpha relation of the broad-line sources. Their distributions of photon energies show no indication of exceptionally high absorption. The optical line emission in these nuclei is likely powered, at least in part, by stellar processes.

AB  - The universe of topics to choose from when teaching an astronomy course is astronomically immense. This wide array of opportunity presents some inherently difficult choices for teachers at all levels on how to limit the scope of the course to make the syllabus manageable. As but one example, consider that even the most experienced astronomy teacher must choose between focusing on the astrophysics of stellar processes or on the nomenclature for stars and constellations because there is rarely time to give both justice. One might go as far as saying that planning an astronomy course is similar to the perspective offered by Michael Pollan in his book The Omnivore's Dilemma, which can be paraphrased as, ``When entering a modern grocery store in the U.S. with unlimited choices, what is it that one chooses to eat and why?'' Indeed, teaching about the entire universe in a single astronomy course involves some serious choices, as one can most certainly not teach everything.

AB  - We use data from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to perform a statistical study on the mid-infrared (IR) properties of a large number (~102) of BL Lac objects---low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a jet beamed toward the Earth. As expected, many BL Lac objects are so highly beamed that their jet synchrotron emission dominates their IR spectral energy distributions. In other BL Lac objects, however, the jet is not strong enough to completely dilute the rest of the AGN emission. We do not see observational signatures of the dusty torus from these weakly beamed BL Lac objects. The lack of observable torus emission is consistent with suggestions that BL Lac objects are fed by radiatively inefficient accretion disks. Implications for the "nature versus nurture" debate for FR I and FR II radio galaxies are briefly discussed. Our study supports the notion that, beyond orientation, accretion rate plays an important role in AGN unification.

AB  - The location of the Gamma-ray emission of powerful blazars is a matter of active debate. Is the location within the UV emitting sub-pc scale broad line region, or farther out at pc scales where the molecular torus IR emission dominates? We present a diagnostic that connects three observables, the synchrotron and external Compton peak frequencies and the Compton dominance (the ratio of Compton to synchrotron luminosity) to the seed photon energy and energy density. We discuss encouraging preliminary results and discuss how to use our diagnostic to understand the location of the Gamma-ray emission as a function of source power through the use of multiwavelength observations.

AB  - We investigate the luminosity evolution of the host galaxies of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) through Hubble Space Telescope imaging of 72 BL Lac objects, including new Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) imaging of nine z>0.6 BL Lacs. With their intrinsically low accretion rates and their strongly beamed jets, BL Lac objects provide a unique opportunity to probe host galaxy evolution independent of the biases and ambiguities implicit in quasar studies. We find that the host galaxies of BL Lac objects evolve strongly, consistent with passive evolution from a period of active star formation in the range 0.5<~z<~2.5, and inconsistent with either passive evolution from a high formation redshift or a nonevolving population. This evolution is broadly consistent with that observed in the hosts of other radio-loud AGNs and inconsistent with the flatter luminosity evolution of quiescent early-type galaxies and radio-quiet hosts. This indicates that active star formation and hence galaxy interactions are associated with the formation of radio-loud AGNs and that these host galaxies preferentially accrete less material after their formation epoch than galaxies without powerful radio jets. We discuss possible explanations for the link between merger history and the incidence of a radio jet.

AB  - A significant fraction of nearby galaxies show evidence of weak nuclear activity unrelated to normal stellar processes. Recent high-resolution, multiwavelength observations indicate that the bulk of this activity derives from black hole accretion with a wide range of accretion rates. The low accretion rates that typify most low-luminosity active galactic nuclei induce significant modifications to their central engine. The broad-line region and obscuring torus disappear in some of the faintest sources, and the optically thick accretion disk transforms into a three-component structure consisting of an inner radiatively inefficient accretion flow, a truncated outer thin disk, and a jet or outflow. The local census of nuclear activity supports the notion that most, perhaps all, bulges host a central supermassive black hole, although the existence of active nuclei in at least some late-type galaxies suggests that a classical bulge is not a prerequisite to seed a nuclear black hole.

AB  - We use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and visual classifications of morphology from the Galaxy Zoo project to study black hole growth in the nearby universe (z < 0.05) and to break down the active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxy population by color, stellar mass, and morphology. We find that the black hole growth at luminosities L[O III] >1040 erg s-1 in early- and late-type galaxies is fundamentally different. AGN host galaxies as a population have a broad range of stellar masses (1010-1011 M sun), reside in the green valley of the color-mass diagram and their central black holes have median masses around 106.5 M sun. However, by comparing early- and late-type AGN host galaxies to their non-active counterparts, we find several key differences: in early-type galaxies, it is preferentially the galaxies with the least massive black holes that are growing, while in late-type galaxies, it is preferentially the most massive black holes that are growing. The duty cycle of AGNs in early-type galaxies is strongly peaked in the green valley below the low-mass end (1010 M sun) of the red sequence at stellar masses where there is a steady supply of blue cloud progenitors. The duty cycle of AGNs in late-type galaxies on the other hand peaks in massive (1011 M sun) green and red late-types which generally do not have a corresponding blue cloud population of similar mass. At high-Eddington ratios (L/L Edd>0.1), the only population with a substantial fraction of AGNs are the low-mass green valley early-type galaxies. Finally, the Milky Way likely resides in the "sweet spot" on the color-mass diagram where the AGN duty cycle of late-type galaxies is highest. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the role of AGNs in the evolution of galaxies.

AB  - Residual star formation at late times in early-type galaxies and their progenitors must be suppressed in order to explain the population of red, passively evolving systems we see today. Likewise, residual or newly accreted reservoirs of molecular gas that are fueling star formation must be destroyed. This suppression of star formation in early-type galaxies is now commonly attributed to active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback wherein the reservoir of gas is heated and expelled during a phase of accretion onto the central supermassive black hole. However, direct observational evidence for a link between the destruction of this molecular gas and an AGN phase has been missing so far. We present new mm-wavelength observations from the IRAM 30 m telescope of a sample of low-redshift SDSS early-type galaxies currently undergoing this process of quenching of late-time star formation. Our observations show that the disappearance of the molecular gas coincides within less than 100 Myr with the onset of accretion onto the black hole and is too rapid to be due to star formation alone. Since our sample galaxies are not associated to powerful quasar activity or radio jets, we conclude that low-luminosity AGN episodes are sufficient to suppress residual star formation in early-type galaxies. This "suppression mode" of AGN feedback is very different from the "truncation mode" linked to powerful quasar activity during early phases of galaxy formation.

AB  - The growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies are thought to be linked, but the precise nature of this symbiotic relationship is still poorly understood. Both observations and simulations of galaxy formation suggest that the energy input from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), as the central supermassive black hole accretes material and grows, heats the interstellar material and suppresses star formation. In this Letter, we show that most host galaxies of moderate-luminosity supermassive black holes in the local universe have intermediate optical colors that imply the host galaxies are transitioning from star formation to quiescence, the first time this has been shown to be true for all AGNs independent of obscuration. The intermediate colors suggest that star formation in the host galaxies ceased roughly 100 Myr ago. This result indicates that either the AGNs are very long lived, accreting for more than 1 Gyr beyond the end of star formation, or there is a ~100 Myr time delay between the shutdown of star formation and detectable black hole growth. The first explanation is unlikely given current estimates for AGN lifetimes, so low-luminosity AGNs must shut down star formation before substantial black hole accretion activity is detected. The scarcity of AGN host galaxies in the blue cloud reported here challenges scenarios where significant star formation and black hole growth are coeval. Lastly, these observations also strongly support the "Unified Model" of AGNs as the host galaxy colors are independent of obscuration toward the central engine.

AB  - A major amendment in recent models of hierarchical galaxy formation is the inclusion of so-called active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The energy input from an active central massive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxies at later epochs. A major problem is that this process is poorly understood, and compelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. In search for signatures of AGN feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16000 early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05 < z < 0.1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data base (MOSES: Morphologically Selected Ellipticals in SDSS). Key in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterion through visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased against recent star formation and nuclear activity. Based on the nebular emission-line characteristics we separate between star formation activity, black hole activity, the composite of the two and quiescence. We find that emission is mostly LINER (low ionization nuclear emission line region) like in high-mass galaxies (sigma > 200kms-1) and roughly evenly distributed between star formation and AGN at intermediate and low (sigma < 100kms-1) masses. The objects with emission (~20 per cent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in the colour-mass diagram. Star-forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, while early-types with AGN are located considerably closer to and almost on the red sequence. Star formation-AGN composites are found right between these two extremes. We further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novel method that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (IR) and stellar absorption indices. We find that in those objects deviating from the red sequence star formation occurred several 100Myr in the past involving 1-10per cent of the total stellar mass. We identify an evolutionary sequence from star formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. This transition process lasts about 1Gyr, and the peak AGN phase occurs roughly half a Gyr after the starburst. The most likely interpretation is that star formation is suppressed by nuclear activity in these objects before they settle on the red sequence. This is empirical evidence for the occurrence of AGN feedback in early-type galaxies at recent epochs.

AB  - We present first results from the Survey of H I in Extremely Low-mass Dwarfs (SHIELD), a multi-configuration Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) study of the neutral gas contents and dynamics of galaxies with H I masses in the 106-107 M sun range detected by the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey. We describe the survey motivation and concept demonstration using Very Large Array imaging of six low-mass galaxies detected in early ALFALFA data products. We then describe the primary scientific goals of SHIELD and present preliminary EVLA and WIYN 3.5 m imaging of the 12 SHIELD galaxies. With only a few exceptions, the neutral gas distributions of these extremely low-mass galaxies are centrally concentrated. In only one system have we detected H I column densities higher than 1021 cm-2. Despite this, the stellar populations of all of these systems are dominated by blue stars. Further, we find ongoing star formation as traced by Halpha emission in 10 of the 11 galaxies with Halpha imaging obtained to date. Taken together these results suggest that extremely low-mass galaxies are forming stars in conditions different from those found in more massive systems. While detailed dynamical analysis requires the completion of data acquisition, the most well-resolved system is amenable to meaningful position-velocity analysis. For AGC 749237, we find well-ordered rotation of 30 km s-1 at ~40'' distance from the dynamical center. At the adopted distance of 3.2 Mpc, this implies the presence of a gsim1 × 108 M sun dark matter halo and a baryon fraction lsim0.1.

AB  - The straw person model (SPM), in which there are two basic types of AGN, the radio quiets and the radio louds, is presented. For each type there is a range in intrinsic luminosity, and the luminosity controls some properties such as the Fanaroff and Riley classes. Evidence to the effect that orientation effects are important and widespread is presented. A list of types and a summary of the phenomenology of the quiets, a detailed description of the prototype Seyfert 2/1, NGC 1068, and an update on polarization observations of quiets in general, as it bears on unified models, are provided. Evidence is presented for unification of the narrow line radio galaxies with the broad line radio galaxies and lobe-dominant radio quasars, and the resulting relaxation or resolution of the statistical anomalies associated with relativistic beaming.

AB  - Using the Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN), we have acquired a high spatial resolution spectral image of the OH megamaser (OHMM) in the nearby starburst 'galaxy' known as IIZw 096. We have also acquired optical B, V, R, I and Halpha images with the 1.5-m telescope in San Pedro Mártir. By comparing the MERLIN observations with Hubble archive images, we are able to pinpoint the location of the OH maser emission in this object; the OHMM emission seems to be associated with a faint and reddish, compact-round structure (a few hundred parsecs) off-centre of a merging system of galaxies. From the colour and strong Halpha emission, this object is consistent with the remains of the nucleus of a very perturbed galaxy in interaction. Assuming a Keplerian bounded system the mass necessary to produce a velocity range of ≈200 km s-1 for the OHMM is of the order of 109 M&sun;, which is consistent with a massive black hole. Consequently, although the OHMM was previously suspected to be of starburst origin, our analysis suggests that an active galactic nucleus (AGN) could also be present in this merging system making it a composite source. IIZw 096 is a nearby example which shows how high spatial resolution data of the OHMM emission region, and supporting optical data, can be extremely helpful in determining the nature (starburst, AGN or composite) of such phenomenon.

AB  - The Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS Camera 2 was used for H-band imaging of 12 BL Lacertae objects taken from the larger sample observed with the WFPC2 in the R band by Urry and coworkers and Scarpa and coworkers. Ten of the 12 BL Lacs are clearly resolved, and the detected host galaxies are large, bright ellipticals with average absolute magnitude <MH>=-26.2+/-0.45 mag and effective radius <re>=10+/-5 kpc. The rest-frame integrated color of the host galaxies is on average <R-H>=2.3+/-0.3, consistent with the value for both radio galaxies and normal, nonactive elliptical galaxies and indicating that the dominant stellar population is old. The host galaxies tend to be bluer in their outer regions than in their cores, with average color gradient Delta(R-H)/Deltalogr=-0.2 mag, again consistent with results for normal nonactive elliptical galaxies. The infrared Kormendy relation, derived for the first time for BL Lac host galaxies, is mue=3.8logre+14.8, fully in agreement with the relation for normal ellipticals. The close similarity between BL Lac host galaxies and normal ellipticals suggests that the active nucleus has surprisingly little effect on the host galaxy. This supports a picture in which all elliptical galaxies harbor black holes that can be actively accreting for some fraction of their lifetime.

AB  - We report on the optical properties of a sample of 30 BL Lac host galaxies in the redshift range 0.03<z<0.2, as derived from Hubble Space Telescope observations. All galaxies are fully resolved in the WFPC2 (F702W filter) images, allowing a quantitative analysis in two dimensions. Most and possibly all of these galaxies have characteristics very similar to those of ``normal'' giant ellipticals. The luminosity, ellipticity, isophote twisting, and amount of disky or boxy isophotes are consistent with those found in nonactive ellipticals and in radio galaxies. In all cases the BL Lac nucleus is well centered in the main body of its host galaxy, a result that argues strongly against the microlensing hypothesis for any significant fraction of the population. A search for faint substructures in the host galaxies has not revealed notable signatures of tidal distortions or subcomponents (faint disks, bars, X features, etc.), and with only one exception, there are no prominent dusty features in the central regions. Instead, the BL Lac host galaxies are smooth and unperturbed, suggesting that strong external gravitational interactions are not important to ongoing activity. A careful examination of the environment around the nucleus, however, shows a high incidence of close companion objects, whose nature remains unclear pending spectroscopic observations.

AB  - We have used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 camera to survey 132 BL Lac objects comprising seven complete radio-, X-ray-, and optically selected samples. We obtained useful images for 110 targets spanning the redshift range 0<~z<~1.3. These represent an unbiased subsample of the original 132 since they were snapshots selected to fill random holes in the HST schedule. The exposure times ranged from a few hundred to ~1000 s, increasing with redshift. Most images were taken in the F702W filter; those already observed in F814W during Cycle 5 were reobserved in F606W to give broader wavelength coverage. The data were analyzed uniformly, and both statistical and systematic errors were estimated (the latter dominate). In 2/3 of the BL Lac images, host galaxies are detected, including nearly all for z<0.5 (58 of 63). In contrast, only one-quarter of the BL Lac objects with z>0.5 (six of 22) were resolved because of the relatively short exposure times, and these tend to be very luminous host galaxies. The highest redshift host galaxy detected is in a BL Lac object at z=0.664. HST data add critical morphological information in the range a few tenths to a few arcseconds. In 58 of the 72 resolved host galaxies, a de Vaucouleurs profile is significantly preferred, at >~99% confidence, over a pure exponential disk; the two fits are comparable in the remaining 14 cases because of their generally lower signal-to-noise ratios. These results limit the number of disk systems to at most 8% of BL Lac objects (at 99% confidence) and are consistent with all BL Lac host galaxies being ellipticals. The detected host galaxies are luminous ellipticals with a median absolute K-corrected magnitude of MR~-23.7+/-0.6 mag (rms dispersion), at least 1 mag brighter than M* and comparable to brightest cluster galaxies. The galaxy morphologies are generally smooth and undisturbed, with small or negligible ellipticities (ε<~0.2). The half-light surface brightness is anticorrelated with half-light radius in quantitatively the same way as other elliptical galaxies, indicating that apart from their highly active nuclei, BL Lac objects appear to be absolutely normal ellipticals. There is no correlation between host galaxy and observed nuclear magnitude or estimated jet power corrected for beaming. If black hole mass is correlated linearly with bulge mass in general, this implies a large range in Eddington ratio. The host galaxies of the radio-selected and X-ray-selected BL Lac objects are comparable in both morphology and luminosity, strongly suggesting that nuclear properties do not have a dramatic effect on large-scale host galaxy properties, or vice versa. BL Lac objects have extended radio powers and host galaxy magnitudes very much like those of FR I galaxies, and quite distinct from FR II's, which instead are more similar to quasars. Thus the present data strongly support the unification picture with FR I galaxies constituting the bulk of the parent population of BL Lac objects.

AB  - Recent claims that the strength B IGMF of the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) is >~ 10-15 G are based on upper limits to the expected cascade flux in the GeV band produced by blazar TeV photons absorbed by the extragalactic background light. This limit depends on an assumption that the mean blazar TeV flux remains constant on timescales >~ 2(B IGMF/10-18G)2/(E/10 GeV)2 yr for an IGMF coherence length ≈1 Mpc, where E is the measured photon energy. Restricting TeV activity of 1ES 0229+200 to ≈3-4 years during which the source has been observed leads to a more robust lower limit of B IGMF >~ 10-18 G, which can be larger by an order of magnitude if the intrinsic source flux above ≈5-10 TeV from 1ES 0229+200 is strong.

AB  - We study the four BL Lac objects (RGB J0152+017, 1ES 0229+200, 1ES 0347-121 and PKS 0548-322) detected in the TeV band but not present in the first Fermi-LAT (1FGL) catalogue of the Fermi/Large Area Telescope (LAT). We analyse the 24 months of LAT data deriving gamma-ray fluxes or upper limits that we use to assemble their spectral energy distributions (SED). We model the SEDs with a standard one-zone leptonic model, also including the contribution of the reprocessed radiation in the multi-GeV band, emitted by the pairs produced through the conversion of the primary TeV emission by interaction with the cosmic optical-infrared background. For simplicity, in the calculation of this component we adopt an analytical approach including some simplifying assumptions, in particular (i) the blazar high-energy emission is considered on average stable over times of the order of 107 yr and (ii) the observer is exactly on-axis. We compare the physical parameters derived by the emission model with those of other high-energy emitting BL Lacs, confirming that TeV BL Lacs with a rather small GeV flux are characterized by extremely low values of the magnetic field and large values of the electron energies. The comparison between the flux in the GeV band and that expected from the reprocessed TeV emission allows us to confirm and strengthen the lower limit of B≳ 10-15 G for the intergalactic magnetic field using a theoretically motivated spectrum for the primary high-energy photons.

AB  - Lower limits on the power emitted in ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), which are assumed to be protons with energy >~ 1017-1020 eV, are derived for TeV blazars with the assumption that the observed TeV gamma-rays are generated due to interactions of these protons with cosmic microwave photons. The limits depend on the spectrum of the injected UHECR protons. While for a --2.2 injection spectrum the lower limits on the powers emitted in UHECRs by 1ES 0229+200, 1ES 1101--232, and 1ES 0347--121 are lower than their respective synchrotron luminosities (~1046 erg s--1), in the case of 1ES 1426+428 it exceeds the corresponding synchrotron luminosity by up to an order of magnitude. The proposed Auger North Observatory should be able to detect 4 × 1019 eV cosmic-ray (CR) protons from 1ES 1426+428 within a few years of operation and test the TeV gamma-ray production model by UHECR energy losses while propagating along the line of sight or constrain the intergalactic magnetic field to be larger than ~10--16 G in case of no detection. The lower limits on the apparent-isotropic jet power from accelerated 1010-1020 eV proton spectra in the blazar jet is of the order of the Eddington luminosity of a 109 M &sun; black hole for a CR injection spectrum --2.2 or harder for all blazars considered except for 1ES 1426+428. In the case of the latter, the apparent-isotropic jet power exceeds the Eddington luminosity by an order of magnitude. For an injection spectrum softer than --2.2, as is required to fit the observed CR data above ~1017-1018 eV, the Eddington luminosity is exceeded by the lower limits on the jet power for all blazars considered.

AB  - A new spectrometer for the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) is being built jointly by the NRAO and the CASPER, University of California, Berkeley. The spectrometer uses 8 bit ADCs and will be capable of processing up to 1.25 GHz bandwidth from 8 dual polarized beams. This mode will be used to process data from focal plane arrays. The spectrometer supports observing mode with 8 tunable digital sub-bands within the 1.25 GHz bandwidth. The spectrometer can also be configured to process a bandwidth of up to 10 GHz with 64 tunable sub-bands from a dual polarized beam. The vastly enhanced backend capabilities will support several new science projects with the GBT.

AB  - The disk-wind scenario for the broad-line region (BLR) and toroidal obscuration in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) predicts the disappearance of the BLR at low luminosities. In accordance with the model predictions, data from a nearly complete sample of nearby AGNs show that the BLR disappears at luminosities lower than 5 × 1039(M/107 Msun)2/3 ergs-1, where M is the black hole mass. The radiative efficiency of accretion onto the black hole is lsim10-3 for these sources, indicating that their accretion is advection-dominated.

AB  - We construct a catalog of radio sources detected by the Green Bank 6 cm survey GB6, Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) (20 cm), and Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) (92 cm) radio surveys, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical survey. The 2.7 million entries in the publicly-available master catalog are comprised of the closest three FIRST to NVSS matches (within 30'') and vice versa, and unmatched sources from each survey. Entries are supplemented by data from the other radio and optical surveys, where available. All objects with even a small probability of physical association are included, such that catalog users can easily implement their own selection criteria for data analysis. We perform data analysis in the ~ 3000 deg2 region of sky where the surveys overlap, which contains 140,000 NVSS-FIRST sources, of which 64,000 are detected by WENSS and 12,000 by GB6. About one third of each sample is detected by the SDSS. An automated classification method based on 20 cm fluxes defines three radio morphology classes: complex, resolved, and compact. Radio color-magnitude-morphology diagrams for these classes show structure suggestive of strong underlying physical correlations. Complex and resolved sources tend to have a steep spectral slope (alpha ~ -0.8) that is nearly constant from 6 to 92 cm, while the compact class (unresolved on ~5'' scale by FIRST) contains a significant number of flat-spectrum (alpha ~ 0) sources. In the optically-detected sample, quasars dominate the flat-spectrum compact sources while steep-spectrum and resolved objects contain substantial numbers of both quasars and galaxies. Differential radio counts of quasars and galaxies are similar at bright flux levels (>100 mJy at 20 cm), while at fainter levels the quasar counts are significantly reduced below galaxy counts. The optically-undetected sample is strongly biased toward steep-spectrum sources. In samples of quasars and galaxies with SDSS spectra (2885 and 1288 respectively), we find that radio properties such as spectral slope, morphology, and radio loudness are correlated with optical color and luminosity.

AB  - We study galaxies that host both nuclear star clusters and AGNs, implying the presence of a massive black hole. We select a sample of 176 galaxies with previously detected nuclear star clusters that range from ellipticals to late-type spirals. We search for AGNs in this sample using optical spectroscopy and archival radio and X-ray data. We find galaxies of all Hubble types and with a wide range of masses (109-1011 Msolar) hosting both AGNs and nuclear star clusters. From the optical spectra, we classify 10% of the galaxies as AGN and an additional 15% as composite, indicating a mix of AGN and star formation spectra. The fraction of nucleated galaxies with AGNs increases strongly as a function of galaxy and nuclear star cluster mass. For galaxies with both a nuclear star cluster and a black hole, we find that the masses of these two objects are quite similar. However, nondetections of black holes in Local Group nuclear star clusters show that not all clusters host black holes of similar masses. We discuss the implications of our results for the formation of nuclear star clusters and massive black holes.

AB  - Results of a sensitive VLA survey of nearby E/S0 galaxies are presented. The 204 galaxies surveyed, plus 12 additional galaxies with existing VLA images, comprise a volume- and optical magnitude-limited sample. The discussion focuses on the relation between radio powers and optical luminosities, whether the radio emission is driven by an active nucleus or by recent star formation, and what galaxian properties might enhance nuclear activity in an elliptical galaxy. It is suggested that the 67 ellipticals in the sample should be targets of sensitive searches for HI, optical emission-line gas, and X-ray emitting gas.

AB  - We use a comprehensive database of black hole masses (MBH) and nuclear luminosities to investigate the relationship between radio emission and MBH. Our sample covers a wide range of nuclear activity, from nearby inactive nuclei to classical Seyfert 1 nuclei and luminous quasars. Contrary to some previous studies, we find that the radio continuum power, either integrated for the entire galaxy or isolated for the core, correlates poorly with MBH. The degree of nuclear radio loudness, parameterized by the radio-to-optical luminosity ratio R, also shows no clear dependence on MBH. Radio-loud nuclei exist in galaxies with a wide range of MBH, from ~106 to a few times 109 Msolar, and in a variety of hosts, from disk-dominated spiral to giant elliptical galaxies. We demonstrate that R is strongly inversely correlated with L/LE, the ratio of nuclear luminosity to the Eddington luminosity, and hence with the mass accretion rate. Most or all of the weakly active nuclei in nearby galaxies are radio-loud, highly sub-Eddington systems that are plausibly experiencing advection-dominated accretion.

AB  - We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 <= z <= 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10%-15% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M >= 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q_0 < 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda > 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega_Lambda > 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega_M + Omega_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda > 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with Omega_Lambda = 0 and q_0 >= 0.

AB  - Aims: We study the influence of the environment on the evolution of galaxies by investigating the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies of different morphological types and colours at different environmental density levels.  Methods: We construct the LFs separately for galaxies of different morphology (spiral and elliptical) and of different colours (red and blue) using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), correcting the luminosities for the intrinsic absorption. We use the global luminosity density field to define different environments, and analyse the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology and colour. The smoothed bootstrap method is used to calculate confidence regions of the derived luminosity functions.  Results: We find a strong environmental dependency for the LF of elliptical galaxies. The LF of spiral galaxies is almost environment independent, suggesting that spiral galaxy formation mechanisms are similar in different environments. Absorption by the intrinsic dust influences the bright-end of the LF of spiral galaxies. After attenuation correction, the brightest spiral galaxies are still about 0.5 mag less luminous than the brightest elliptical galaxies, except in the least dense environment, where spiral galaxies dominate the LF at every luminosity. Despite the extent of the SDSS survey, the influence of single rich superclusters is present in the galactic LF of the densest environment.

AB  - We present a detailed empirical assessment of how the galaxy luminosity function and stellar luminosity density evolves over the last half of the universe's age (0.2<z<1.2) for galaxies of different spectral energy distributions (SED). The results are based on  ~ 25 000 galaxies (Rla24 ) with redshift measurements (sigmaz ~ 0.03) and SEDs across lambdaobs~ 350... 930 nm. The redshifts and SEDs were derived from medium-band photometry in 17 filters, observed as part of the COMBO-17 survey (``Classifying Objects by Medium-Band Observations in 17 Filters'') over three disjoint fields with a total area of 0.78 square degrees. Luminosity functions (LF), binned in redshift and SED-type, are presented in the restframe passbands of the SDSS r-band, the Johnson B-band and a synthetic UV continuum band at 280 nm.   We find that the luminosity function depends strongly on SED-type at all redshifts covered. The shape of the LF, i.e. the faint-end power-law slope, does depend on SED type, but not on redshift. However, the redshift evolution of the characteristic luminosity M* and density phi * depends strongly on SED-type: (1) Early-type galaxies, defined as redder than a present-day reference Sa spectrum, become drastically more abundant towards low redshift, by a factor of 10 in the number density phi * from z=1.1 to now, and by a factor of 4 in their contribution to the co-moving r-band luminosity density, jr. (2) Galaxies resembling present-day Sa- to Sbc-colours show a co-moving number density and contribution to jr that does not vary much with redshift. (3) Galaxies with blue spectra reflecting strong star formation decrease towards low redshift both in luminosity and density, and by a factor of 4 in their jr contribution. Summed over all SED types and galaxy luminosities, the comoving luminosity density decreases towards low redshift, between z=1.1 and now, by a small amount in restframe r and B, but by a factor of  ~ 6 in restframe 280 nm. At z=1.1, galaxies redder than Sbc's, contribute 40% to the total jr, which increases to 75% by z=0. For lambdarest=280 nm, this increase is from 12% to 25% over the same redshift interval.   Comparison of the three independent sight-lines shows that our results are not significantly affected by large-scale structure. Our lowest redshift bin at z= [0.2,0.4] largely agrees with the recent assessment of the present-day galaxy population by SDSS and 2dFGRS and deviates only by an excess of ``faint blue galaxies'' at z ~  0.3 compared to very local samples. Overall our findings provide a set of new and much more precise constraints to model the waning of overall star formation activity, the demise of star-bursts and the strong emergence of ``old'' galaxies, with hardly any young population, over the last 6-8 Gigayears.

AB  - We present rest-frame, R-band, galaxy luminosity function measurements for three different redshift ranges: 0.5<=z<=0.75, 0.75<=z<=1.0, and 1.0<=z<=1.5. Our measurements are based on photometric redshifts for ~3000 H-band-selected galaxies with apparent magnitudes 17<=H<=20 from the Las Campanas Infrared Survey. We show that our photometric redshifts are accurate with an rms dispersion between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of sigmaz/(1+z)~0.08. Using galaxies identified in the Hubble Deep Field-South and Chandra Deep Field-South regions, we find, respectively, that 7.3%+/-0.2% and 16.7%+/-0.4% of the H<=20 galaxies are at z>=1. We first demonstrate that the systematic uncertainty inherent in the luminosity function measurements because of uncertainties in photometric redshifts is nonnegligible and therefore must be accounted for. We then develop a technique to correct for this systematic error by incorporating the redshift error functions of individual galaxies in the luminosity function analysis. The redshift error functions account for the non-Gaussian characteristics of photometric redshift uncertainties. They are the products of a convolution between the corresponding redshift likelihood functions of individual galaxies and a Gaussian distribution function that characterizes template-mismatch variance. We demonstrate, based on a Monte Carlo simulation, that we are able to completely recover the bright end of the intrinsic galaxy luminosity function using this technique. Finally, we calculate the luminosity function separately for the total H-band-selected sample and for a subsample of early-type galaxies that have a best-fit spectral type of E/S0 or Sab from the photometric redshift analysis. The primary results of this analysis are (1) the galaxy luminosity functions are consistent with a Schechter form, (2) the evolution of the comoving luminosity density l of H-band-selected galaxies is characterized by Deltalogl/Deltalog(1+z)=0.6+/-0.1 at rest frame 6800 Å, and (3) lR for color-selected, early-type galaxies exhibits moderate evolution from z~1.5 to ~0.3. Specifically, lR for these red galaxies brighter than 1.0 (1.6) L* could decrease with increasing redshift by at most a factor of 3 (6) over this redshift range after removing possible stellar brightening according to the most extreme stellar evolution scenario.

AB  - We present K-band imaging for 15 of the CNOC1 clusters. The extensive spectroscopic data set available for these clusters allows us to determine the cluster K-band luminosity function and density profile without the need for statistical background subtraction. The luminosity density and number density profiles can be described by NFW models with concentration parameters of cl=4.28+/-0.70 and cg=4.13+/-0.57, respectively. Comparing these to the dynamical mass analysis of the same clusters shows that they are similar to the cluster dark matter profile. The luminosity functions show that the evolution of K* over the redshift range 0.2<z<0.5 is consistent with a scenario in which the majority of stars in cluster galaxies form at high redshift (zf>1.5) and evolve passively thereafter. The best fit for the faint-end slope of the luminosity function is alpha=-0.84+/-0.08, which indicates that it does not evolve between z=0 and 0.3. Using principal component analysis of the spectra, we classify cluster galaxies as either star-forming/recently star-forming (EM+BAL) or non-star-forming (ELL) and compute their respective luminosity functions. The faint-end slope of the ELL luminosity function is much shallower than for the EM+BAL galaxies at z=0.3 and suggests that the number of faint ELL galaxies in clusters decreases by a factor of ~3 from z=0 to 0.3. The redshift evolution of K* for both EM+BAL and ELL types is consistent with a passively evolving stellar population formed at high redshift. Passive evolution in both classes demonstrates that the bulk of the stellar population in all bright cluster galaxies is formed at high redshift, and subsequent transformations in morphology/color/spectral type have little effect on the total stellar mass.

We find that the number of K-band selected cluster galaxies within R500 (the halo occupation number, HON) is well correlated with the cluster dynamical mass (M 500) and X-ray temperature (TX); however, the intrinsic scatter in these scaling relations is 37% and 46%, respectively. Comparison with clusters in the local universe shows that the HON-M500 relation does not evolve significantly between z=0 and z~0.3. This suggests that if dark matter halos are disrupted or undergo significant tidal stripping in high-density regions as seen in numerical simulations, the stellar mass within the halos is tightly bound, and not removed during the process. The total K-band cluster light (L200,K) and K-band-selected richness (parameterized by Bgc,K) are also correlated with both the cluster TX and M200. The total (intrinsic) scatter in the L200,K-M200 and Bgc,K-M200 relations are 43% (31%) and 35% (18%), respectively, and indicates that for massive clusters both L200,K and Bgc,K can predict M200 with accuracy similar to that of TX, LX, or optical richness (Bgc). Examination of the mass-to-light ratios of the clusters shows that similarly to local clusters, the K-band mass-to-light ratio is an increasing function of halo mass. Using the K-band mass-to-light ratios of the clusters, we apply the Oort technique and find Omegam,0=0.22+/-0.02, which agrees well with recent combined concordance cosmology parameters, but, similarly to previous cluster studies, is on the low-density end of preferred values.

AB  - The spatial clustering amplitude (Bgq) is determined for a sample of 44 powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN) at z~=0.2. No significant difference is detected in the richness of the cluster environments of the radio-loud and radio-quiet subsamples, both of which typically inhabit environments as rich as Abell class ~=0. Comparison with radio luminosity-matched samples from Hill & Lilly and Wold et al. suggests that there is no epoch-dependent change in environment richness out to at least z>=0.5 for either radio galaxies or radio quasars. Comparison with the APM cluster survey shows that, contrary to current folklore, powerful AGN do not avoid rich clusters, but rather display a spread in cluster environment, which is perfectly consistent with being drawn at random from the massive elliptical population. Finally, we argue that virtually all Abell class ~=0 clusters contained an active galaxy during the epoch of peak quasar activity at z~2.5.

AB  - We present the result of a projected cross-correlation analysis of AGNs and galaxies at redshifts from 0.3 to 3.0. The Japanese Virtual Observatory (JVO) was used to obtain Subaru Suprime-Cam images and UKIDSS catalog data around AGNs. We investigated 1809 AGNs, which is about a ten-times larger sample than that used in previous studies on AGN-galaxy clustering at redshifts larger than 0.6; 90% of the AGN samples were optically-selected AGN from the SDSS and 2dF catalogs. The galaxy samples at low redshift include many redder objects from the UKIDSS survey, while at higher redshift they are mainly blue galaxies from Suprime-Cam. We found a significant excess of galaxies around the AGNs at redshifts from 0.3 to 1.8. For the low-redshift samples (z < 0.9), we obtained a correlation length of r0 = 5-6h-1 Mpc (gamma = 1.8), which indicates that the AGNs at this redshift range reside in a similar environment around typical local galaxies. We also found that AGNs at higher redshift ranges reside in a denser environment than lower redshift AGNs. For z = 1.3-1.8 AGNs, the cross-correlation length was measured as 11+6-3 Mpc (gamma = 1.8). Considering that our sample of galaxies is based on optical observations with Suprime-Cam at the redshift range, it is expected that blue star-forming galaxies comprise the majority of objects that are observed to be clustered around the AGNs. It has been successfully demonstrated that using the archive through the Virtual Observatory system can provide a powerful tool for investigating the small-scale environment of intermediate redshift AGNs.

AB  - An analysis of the environments around a sample of 28 3CR radio galaxies with redshifts 0.6<z<1.8 is presented, based primarily upon K-band images down to K~20 taken using the UK Infrared Telescope (UKIRT). A net overdensity of K-band galaxies is found in the fields of the radio galaxies, with the mean excess counts being comparable to that expected for clusters of Abell Class 0 richness. A sharp peak is found in the angular cross-correlation amplitude centred on the radio galaxies that, for reasonable assumptions about the luminosity function of the galaxies, corresponds to a spatial cross-correlation amplitude between those determined for low-redshift Abell Class 0 and 1 clusters. These data are complemented by J-band images also from UKIRT, and by optical images from the Hubble Space Telescope. The fields of the lower redshift (z<~0.9) radio galaxies in the sample generally show well-defined near-infrared colour-magnitude relations with little scatter, indicating a significant number of galaxies at the redshift of the radio galaxy; the relations involving colours at shorter wavelengths than the 4000Å break show considerably greater scatter, suggesting that many of the cluster galaxies have low levels of recent or on-going star formation. At higher redshifts the colour-magnitude sequences are less prominent owing to the increased field galaxy contribution at faint magnitudes, but there is a statistical excess of galaxies with the very red infrared colours (J-K>~1.75) expected of old cluster galaxies at these redshifts. Although these results are appropriate for the mean of all of the radio galaxy fields, there exist large field-to-field variations in the richness of the environments. Many, but certainly not all, powerful z~1 radio galaxies lie in (proto)cluster environments.

AB  - The results of an investigation into the cluster environments of radio galaxies spanning a wide range of radio power within a narrow range of redshift at z about 0.5 are presented. It is found that about half of the powerful classical double radio sources at z about 0.5 inhabit rich clusters, even though similar sources avoid such environments at low redshift. It is shown that this change includes not only the most powerful sources, but also sources of moderate power where a direct comparison with low-redshift sources is possible. The lowest power radio galaxies appear to inhabit similar environments at both epochs. In deriving these results, it is shown that the absolute magnitudes of the radio galaxies, and probably also of characteristic L(asterisk) galaxies, have not changed significantly since z about 0.5. The implications for the cosmological evolution of the radio source population are discussed.

AB  - In this paper, we present high-resolution optical spectra and optical classifications from our large sample of 285 warm infrared galaxies 108<LIR<1012.5 Lsolar. We have classified these galaxies using new theoretical lines on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We use a theoretical extreme mixing line between the starburst and AGN regions to classify LINER galaxies and we define a theoretical boundary separating AGNs from starbursts. We find that many galaxies previously classified as LINERs appear to lie on a mixing sequence between starburst and AGN type galaxies. These are likely to be of a composite nature with their excitation being a combination of photoionization due to hot stars plus either ionization by a power-law radiation field associated with an AGN or shock excitation where the shock may result from such processes as cooling flows, superwind activity, or an accretion disk around an AGN. We compare our theory-based classification scheme with the previous semiempirical scheme of Veilleux & Osterbrock . We find that our classification method results in 6% ambiguity in classifications between the different diagnostic diagrams compared with 16% ambiguity using the traditional Veilleux & Osterbrock method. We find that 70% of the galaxies in our sample are classified optically as starburst, 17% are Seyfert 2, 4% are Seyfert 1, and 0.4% are LINERs. A further 2% of our sample are certainly composite galaxies. A fraction (20%) of the Seyfert galaxies, 3% of the starburst galaxies, and 71% of the ambiguous galaxies are possibly composite in nature (11% of the total sample).

AB  - A spectroscopic survey of a sample of 200 luminous IRAS galaxies (LIGs: L_ir_^7^ > 3 x 10^10^ L_sun_; H_0_ = 75 km s^-1^ Mpc^-1^) was carried out using the Palomar 5 meter and University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescopes. Kim et al. (1995) described the data-taking and data-reduction procedures and presented line and continuum measurements extracted from the nucleus of these objects. In this paper, the nuclear data are combined with circumnuclear measurements on 23 of these galaxies to investigate the properties of the line-emitting gas and underlying stellar population in and out of the nucleus. The nuclear spectra of these galaxies were classified as H II region-like" or "AGN-like" using a large number of line-ratio diagnostics corrected for the underlying stellar absorption features. This correction is an important source of errors in some previous studies. The emission-line spectra of many AGNs were found to-be of relatively low ionization level and were therefore classified as LINER. We confirm that both the fraction of LIGs with AGN spectra and the fraction of Seyferts among the AGN increase with infrared luminosity, reaching values of 62% and 54% at the highest observed luminosities, respectively. The fraction of LINERs, on the other hand, is relatively constant at ~27%. The source of the ionization of the emission-line gas often is a function of the distance from the nucleus. Based on the emission-line ratios and the strengths of the stellar absorption features, circumnuclear starburst activity is a common feature of LIGs, regardless of their nuclear spectral types. The emission-line, absorption-line, continuum, radio, and IRAS properties of the LINERs suggest that most of the LINER emission in these infrared-selected galaxies is produced through shock ionization rather than photoionization by a genuine active nucleus. The nuclear region of Seyfert LIGs is found to be slightly less reddened than that of the LINERs and H II galaxies. The dust distribution generally is concentrated toward the nucleus, in agreement with the often peaky distribution of the molecular gas observed in these galaxies. Inverted dust profiles in which the nucleus appears less dusty than the circumnuclear region are observed in only three LIGs, all of which have AGN emission-line characteristics (one Seyfert 2 galaxy and two LINERs). Low nuclear dust content appears to favor the detection of active nuclei. This may be due to selection effects or may reflect real physical differences between these classes of objects: galaxies with Seyfert emission lines may be at a more advanced stage of dust destruction/expulsion than H II LIGs. Complex optical depth effects may also explain these results without invoking a smaller amount of dust in the nucleus. The Hbeta and Mg I b absorption features are stronger in the nuclei of AGNs (especially among the LINERs) than in H II LIGs, suggesting that AGN LIGs are at a more advanced stage of stellar evolution than H II LIGs. Further support for this scenario comes from the fact that AGNs are found more frequently in advanced mergers than H II galaxies (only two Seyfert galaxies are detected in systems with well-separated nuclei). However, this last result may be a luminosity effect rather than an effect related to the dominant nuclear source of ionization. Moreover, the absorption-line data may simply reflect the fact that galaxies with powerful H II regions show evidence for young stars while galaxies with AGNs do not. The radial variations of the Hbeta and Mg I b absorption features indicate the presence of a strong source of featureless continuum in the nucleus of nearly all LIGs, regardless of their nuclear spectral types. Contamination by the circumnuclear starburst prevents us from determining the extent of this continuum source. The [O III] profiles of both Seyfert and LINER LIGs were found to be broader on average than those of H II objects. Nearly 20% of the LIGs in our sample have line widths larger than 600 km s^-1^. We find that most of the galaxies in which we could determine the radial variations of the [O III] line width present broader profiles in the circumnuclear region than at the nucleus. When combined with published data on a few other well-studied LIGs, these results suggest that large-scale nuclear winds are common in these objects and are an efficient way of getting rid of the obscuring material in the nuclear region. The spatially extended LINER emission observed in many of these objects is probably due to shock ionization resulting from the interaction of the wind-accelerated gas with the ambient material of the host galaxy.

AB  - We have compiled a large sample of low-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs) identified via their emission-line characteristics from the spectroscopic data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Since emission lines are often contaminated by stellar absorption lines, we developed an objective and efficient method of subtracting the stellar continuum from every galaxy spectrum before making emission-line measurements. The distribution of the measured Halpha FWHM values of emission-line galaxies is strongly bimodal, with two populations separated at about 1200 km s-1. This feature provides a natural separation between narrow-line and broad-line AGNs. The narrow-line AGNs are identified using standard emission-line ratio diagnostic diagrams. There are 1317 broad-line and 3074 narrow-line AGNs identified from about 100,000 galaxy spectra selected over 1151 deg2. This sample is used in a companion paper to determine the emission-line luminosity function of AGNs.

AB  - We have identified 7824 radio sources from the 1.4GHz NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) with galaxies brighter than K = 12.75mag in the Second Incremental Data Release of the 6 degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGSDR2). The resulting sample of redshifts and optical spectra for radio sources over an effective sky area of 7076deg2 (about 17 per cent of the celestial sphere) is the largest of its kind ever obtained. NVSS radio sources associated with galaxies in the 6dFGS span a redshift range 0.003 < z < 0.3 and have median . Through visual examination of 6dF spectra we have identified the dominant mechanism for radio emission from each galaxy. 60 per cent are fuelled by star formation and 40 per cent are fuelled by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered by a supermassive black hole. We have accurately determined the local radio luminosity function (RLF) at 1.4GHz for both classes of radio source and have found it to agree well with other recent determinations. From the RLF of star-forming galaxies we derive a local star formation density of 0.022 +/- 0.001Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3, in broad agreement with recent determinations at radio and other wavelengths.  We have split the RLF of radio-loud AGNs into bins of absolute K-band magnitude (MK) and compared this with the underlying K-band galaxy luminosity function of all 6dFGS galaxies to determine the bivariate radio-K-band luminosity function. We verify that radio-loud AGNs preferentially inhabit the brightest and hence most massive host galaxies and show that the fraction of all galaxies which host a radio-loud AGN scales as fradio-loud ~ L2.1K for fradio-loud < 0.3, indicative of a similarly strong scaling with black hole mass and stellar mass.

AB  - We examine the properties of the host galaxies of 22 623 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with 0.02 < z < 0.3 selected from a complete sample of 122 808 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]lambda5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong Hdelta absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.

AB  - We have modeled a large sample of infrared starburst galaxies using both the PEGASE v2.0 and STARBURST99 codes to generate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the young star clusters. PEGASE utilizes the Padova group tracks, while STARBURST99 uses the Geneva group tracks, allowing comparison between the two. We used our MAPPINGS III code to compute photoionization models that include a self-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We use the standard optical diagnostic diagrams as indicators of the hardness of the EUV radiation field in these galaxies. These diagnostic diagrams are most sensitive to the spectral index of the ionizing radiation field in the 1-4 ryd region. We find that warm infrared starburst galaxies contain a relatively hard EUV field in this region. The PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in the 1-4 ryd range than that of STARBURST99. As the spectrum in this regime is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, this discrepancy is most likely due to the differences in stellar atmosphere models used for the W-R stars. The PEGASE models use the Clegg & Middlemass planetary nebula nuclei (PNN) atmosphere models for the W-R stars, whereas the STARBURST99 models use the Schmutz, Leitherer, & Gruenwald W-R atmosphere models. We believe that the Schmutz et al. atmospheres are more applicable to the starburst galaxies in our sample; however, they do not produce the hard EUV field in the 1-4 ryd region required by our observations. The inclusion of continuum metal blanketing in the models may be one solution. Supernova remnant (SNR) shock modeling shows that the contribution by mechanical energy from SNRs to the photoionization models is <<20%. The models presented here are used to derive a new theoretical classification scheme for starbursts and active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies based on the optical diagnostic diagrams.

AB  - The Baldwin, Phillips, and Terlevich emission-line ratio diagnostic ([O III]/Hbeta versus [N II]/Halpha, hereafter BPT diagram) efficiently separates galaxies whose signal is dominated by star formation (BPT-SF) from those dominated by active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity (BPT-AGN). Yet this BPT diagram is limited to z < 0.5, the redshift at which [N II]lambda6584 leaves the optical spectral window. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we construct a new diagnostic, or TBT diagram, that is based on rest-frame g - z color, [Ne III]lambda3869, and [O II]lambdalambda3726 + 3729 and can be used for galaxies out to z < 1.4. The TBT diagram identifies 98.7% of the SDSS BPT-AGN as TBT-AGN and 97% of the SDSS BPT-SF as TBT-SF. Furthermore, it identifies 97% of the OPTX Chandra X-ray-selected AGNs as TBT-AGN. This is in contrast to the BPT diagram, which misidentifies 20% of X-ray-selected AGNs as BPT-SF. We use the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey North and Lockman Hole galaxy samples, with their accompanying deep Chandra imaging, to perform X-ray and infrared stacking analyses to further validate our TBT-AGN and TBT-SF selections; that is, we verify the dominance of AGN activity in the former and star formation activity in the latter. Finally, we address the inclusion of the majority of the BPT-comp (sources lying between the BPT-SF and BPT-AGN regimes) in our TBT-AGN regime. We find that the stacked BPT-comp source is X-ray hard (langGammaeffrang = 1.0+0.4 -0.4) and has a high X-ray luminosity to total infrared luminosity ratio. This suggests that, on average, the X-ray signal in BPT-comp is dominated by obscured or low accretion rate AGN activity rather than by star formation, supporting their inclusion in the TBT-AGN regime.  Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.

AB  - We have observed the galaxy environments around a sample of 21 radio-loud, steep-spectrum quasars at 0.5<=z<=0.82, spanning several orders of magnitude in radio luminosity. The observations also include background control fields used to obtain the excess number of galaxies in each quasar field. The galaxy excess was quantified using the spatial galaxy-quasar correlation amplitude, Bgq, and an Abell-type measurement, N0.5. A few quasars are found in relatively rich clusters, but on average, they seem to prefer galaxy groups or clusters of approximately Abell class 0. We have combined our sample with literature samples extending down to z~0.2 and covering the same range in radio luminosity. By using the Spearman statistic to disentangle redshift and luminosity dependences, we detect a weak, but significant, positive correlation between the richness of the quasar environment and the radio luminosity of the quasar. However, we do not find any epoch dependence in Bgq, as has previously been reported for radio quasars and galaxies. We discuss the radio luminosity-cluster richness link and possible explanations for the weak correlation that is seen.

AB  - We have carried out multicolour imaging of a complete sample of radio-loud quasars at 0.6 < z < 1.1 and find groups or clusters of galaxies in the fields of at least eight and possibly 13 of the 21 sources. There is no evidence for an evolution in the richness of the environments of radio-loud quasars from other low-redshift studies to z>~ 0.9. The quasars associated with groups and clusters in our sample do not necessarily reside in the centre of the galaxy distribution, which rarely displays a spherical geometry. Clustering is preferentially associated with small or asymmetric steep-spectrum radio sources. The quasars with the largest projected angular size are, in nearly all cases, found in non-clustered environments. Radio-based selection (including source size) of high-redshift groups and clusters can be a very efficient method of detecting rich environments at these redshifts.  We find that in optical searches for galaxy overdensities above z~ 0.6, multiple filters must be used. If the single-filter counting statistics used by groups at lower redshift are applied to our data, uncertainties are too large to make accurate quantifications of cluster richness. This means that genuine clustering of galaxies about quasars will be missed and, in ~10 per cent of cases, putative clusters turn out to be false detections. The statistics are further diluted by the fact that galaxy overdensities are generally not centred on the quasar.

AB  - The environmental properties of a sample of 31 hard X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) are investigated, from scales of 500 kpc down to 30 kpc, and are compared to a control sample of inactive galaxies. All the AGN lie in the redshift range 0.4 < z < 0.6. The accretion luminosity density of the Universe peaks close to this redshift range, and the AGN in the sample have X-ray luminosities close to the knee in the hard X-ray luminosity function, making them representative of the population that dominated this important phase of energy conversion.  Using both the spatial clustering amplitude and near-neighbour counts, it is found that the AGN have environments that are indistinguishable from normal, inactive galaxies over the same redshift range and with similar optical properties. Typically, the environments are of subcluster richness, in contrast to similar studies of high-z quasars, which are often found in clusters with comparable richness to the Abell R>= 0 clusters.  It is suggested that minor mergers with low-mass companions are a likely candidate for the mechanism by which these modest luminosity AGN are fuelled.

AB  - A popular formation scenario for giant elliptical galaxies proposes that they might have formed from binary mergers of disk galaxies. Difficulties with the scenario that emerged from earlier studies included providing the necessary stellar mass and metallicity, maintaining the tight color-magnitude relation, and avoiding phase-space limits. In this paper we revisit the issue and put constraints on the binary disk merger scenario based on the stellar populations of disk galaxies. We draw the following conclusions: low-redshift collisionless or gaseous mergers of present-day Milky-Way-like disk galaxies do not form present-day elliptical galaxies. Binary mergers of the progenitors of present-day Milky-Way-like disk galaxies could have evolved into intermediate-mass elliptical galaxies (M < M *) if they merged earlier than ≈ 3-4 Gyr ago. Assuming that most present-day disk galaxies formed in a way similar to the Milky Way model presented here, more massive giant ellipticals in general could not have formed from binary mergers of the progenitors of present-day disk galaxies. A major reason for these conclusions is that the mass in metals of a typical disk galaxy is approximately a factor of 4-8 smaller than the mass in metals of a typical early-type galaxy, and this ratio grows to larger values with increasing redshift.

AB  - We use statistical results from a large sample of about 500 blazars, based on two surveys, the Deep X-Ray Radio Blazar Survey (DXRBS), nearly complete, and the ROSAT All-Sky Survey-Green Bank Survey (RGB), to provide new constraints on the spectral energy distribution of blazars, particularly flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). This reassessment is prompted by the discovery of a population of FSRQs with spectral energy distribution similar to that of high-energy-peaked BL Lac objects. The fraction of these sources is sample dependent, being ~10% in DXRBS and ~30% in RGB (and reaching ~80% for the Einstein Medium Sensitivity Survey). We show that these ``X-ray-strong'' radio quasars, which had gone undetected or unnoticed in previous surveys, indeed are the strong-lined counterparts of high-energy-peaked BL Lac objects and have synchrotron peak frequencies, nupeak, much higher than ``classical'' FSRQs, typically in the UV band for DXRBS. Some of these objects may be 100 GeV to TeV emitters, as are several known BL Lac objects with similar broadband spectra. Our large, deep, and homogeneous DXRBS sample does not show anticorrelations between nupeak and radio, broad-line region, or jet power, as expected in the so-called blazar sequence scenario. However, the fact that FSRQs do not reach X-ray-to-radio flux ratios and nupeak values as extreme as BL Lac objects and the elusiveness of high-nupeak high-power blazars suggest that there might be an intrinsic, physical limit to the synchrotron peak frequency that can be reached by strong-lined, powerful blazars. Our findings have important implications for the study of jet formation and physics and its relationship to other properties of active galactic nuclei.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - This paper presents XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray spectroscopy of 10 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) that are candidates to have an X-ray spectrum dominated by jet synchrotron emission. In all these FSRQ, which are less strongly relativistically beamed than blazars, a considerable contribution from a power-law component similar to that present in radio-quiet quasars is required to explain the observed X-ray fluxes and X-ray spectral slopes. As in radio-quiet quasars, their relatively high optical/UV fluxes can be accounted for by a significant contribution from thermal accretion disk emission. The lack of success in finding radio quasars with synchrotron X-rays is attributed to the adopted selection criteria, which were based on the multiwavelength flux ratios of BL Lacertae objects. A refined selection technique, which also involves radio imaging, is proposed to search for these important candidates with the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). On the other hand, the discovered FSRQ with their strong accretion disk signatures are expected to be important probes for studying the poorly understood accretion disk-jet connection.

AB  - We present a catalogue of 39 multiple mergers, found using the mergers catalogue of the Galaxy Zoo project for z < 0.1, and compare them to corresponding semi-analytical galaxies from the Millennium Simulation. We estimate the (volume-limited) multimerger fraction of the local Universe using our sample and find it to be at least 2 orders of magnitude less than binary mergers - in good agreement with the simulations (especially the Munich group). We then investigate the properties of galaxies in binary mergers and multimergers (morphologies, colours, stellar masses and environment) and compare these results with those predicted by the semi-analytical galaxies. We find that multimergers favour galaxies with properties typical of elliptical morphologies and that this is in qualitative agreement with the models. Studies of multimergers thus provide an independent (and largely corroborating) test of the Millennium semi-analytical models.

AB  - The CoNFIG (Combined NVSS-FIRST Galaxies) sample is a new sample of 274 bright radio sources at 1.4 GHz. It was defined by selecting all sources with S1.4GHz >= 1.3 Jy from the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS) in the north field of the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimetres (FIRST) survey. New radio observations obtained with the VLA for 31 of the sources are presented. The sample has complete Fanaroff-Riley (FRI)/FRII morphology identification; optical identifications and redshifts are available for 80 and 89 per cent of the sample, respectively, yielding a mean redshift of ~0.71. One of the goals of this survey is to get better definitions of luminosity distributions and source counts of FRI/FRII sources separately, in order to determine the evolution of the luminosity function for each type of source. We present a preliminary analysis, showing that these data are an important step towards examining various evolutionary schemes for these objects and to confirm or correct the dual population unified scheme for radio active galactic nuclei (AGN). Improving our understanding of radio galaxy evolution will give better insight into the role of AGN feedback in galaxy formation.

AB  - A revised sample of bright radio sources at 178 MHz is defined in order to correct the biases introduced into the 3CR catalog by confusion and partial resolution. The sample is shown to be 96 percent complete to a flux-density limit of 10 Jy for sources smaller than 10 arcmin. The bias of the 3CR catalog against objects of larger angular size is also reduced. Optical identifications are presented for 96 percent of the sources, 71 percent with galaxies and 25 percent with quasars. The radio-galaxy population is found to show strong space-density evolution for luminosities in excess of approximately 10 exp 26.5 W/Hz-sr at 178 MHz (redshifts greater than or approximately equal to 0.2), while the evolutionary properties of galaxies and quasars of the same luminosity and redshift are very similar.

AB  - We construct a simple theoretical model to investigate how entrainment gradually erodes high-speed FR II jets. This process is described by embedding a mixing-layer model developed originally to describe FR I objects in a self-similar model for the lobe structure of classical FR II sources. Following the classical FR II models, we assume that the lobe is dominated by the particles injected from the central jet. The entrainment produces a boundary shear layer which acts at the interface between the dense central jet and the less denser surrounding lobe, and the associated erosion of the jet places interesting limits on the maximum size of FR II sources. The model shows that this limit depends mainly on the initial bulk velocity of the relativistic jet triggered. The bulk velocities of FR IIs suggested by our model are in good agreement with that obtained from direct pc-scale observations on ordinary radio galaxies and quasars. Finally, we discuss how FR IIs may evolve into FR Is upon reaching their maximum, entrainment-limited sizes.

AB  - In examining a select sample of over 200 blazars of known jet kinetic power (L_kin) and well-characterized SEDs, we found (Meyer et al., 2011) that Intermediate synchrotron-peaking (ISP) blazars may have lower gamma-ray output than high synchrotron-peaking (HSP) blazars of similar L_kin, consistent with our hypothesis that ISP blazars are less-beamed versions of HSP blazars, rather than a distinct population. Further, by using the radio core dominance as a measure of relative beaming, we find that gamma-ray luminosity depends on beaming in a consistent way for blazars ranging over all jet kinetic powers (10^42 - 10^46 ergs/s). We re-examine the gamma-ray properties of this core sample of blazars using the 1-year LAT catalog (Abdo et al., 2010). We find that for weak jets, the ratio of inverse Compton to synchrotron emission remains constant with increased beaming, consistent with an SSC model for the jet emission, while the most powerful jets show a strong increase in Compton dominance with orientation, consistent with an external Compton (EC) emission model.

AB  - The paper presents a study of the galaxy populations in 55 rich clusters along with a discussion of the implications for the formation and/or evolution of different morphological types. A well defined relationship is found between local galaxy density and galaxy type, which indicates an increasing elliptical and S0 population and a corresponding decrease in spirals with increasing density. Attention is given to evidence which contradicts the interpretation that these gradients in population result from the production of S0 galaxies when spirals are swept of disk gas by an IGM. In addition, as an alternative to the hypothesis of spiral sweeping, it is suggested that the local density/morphological-type relation reflects the long time scale associated with the formation of the disk component of galaxies. Finally, the data also indicate a trend of increasing luminosity of the spheroidal component with increasing local density.

AB  - We recently argued (Meyer 2011) that the collective properties of radio loud active galactic nuclei point to the existence of two families of sources, one of powerful sources with single velocity jets and one of weaker jets with significant velocity gradients in the radiating plasma. These families also correspond to different accretion modes and therefore different thermal and emission line intrinsic properties: powerful sources have radiatively efficient accretion disks, while in weak sources accretion must be radiatively inefficient. Here, after we briefly review of our recent work, we present the following findings that support our unification scheme: (i) along the broken sequence of aligned objects, the jet kinetic power increases. (ii) in the powerful branch of the sequence of aligned objects the fraction of BLLs decreases with increasing jet power. (iii) for powerful sources, the fraction of BLLs increases for more un-aligned objects, as measured by the core to extended radio emission. Our results are also compatible with the possibility that a given accretion power produces jets of comparable kinetic power.

AB  - We investigate a class of rapidly growing emission line galaxies, known as `Green Peas', first noted by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project because of their peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging. Their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [OIII] lambda5007Å, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to ~1000Å. We discuss a well-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are strongly star forming, although there are some active galactic nuclei interlopers including eight newly discovered narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The star-forming Peas are low-mass galaxies (M ~ 108.5-1010Msolar) with high star formation rates (~10Msolaryr-1), low metallicities (log[O/H] + 12 ~ 8.7) and low reddening [E(B - V) <= 0.25] and they reside in low-density environments. They have some of the highest specific star formation rates (up to ~10-8yr-1) seen in the local Universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds of Myr. The few star-forming Peas with Hubble Space Telescope imaging appear to have several clumps of bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that may indicate recent or ongoing mergers. The Peas are similar in size, mass, luminosity and metallicity to luminous blue compact galaxies. They are also similar to high-redshift ultraviolet-luminous galaxies, e.g. Lyman-break galaxies and Lyalpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which to study the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshift galaxies. Studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essential to understanding the build up of stellar mass in the Universe.

These results, based conditionally upon the number counts, are accurate for both high and low number counts. We show explicit analytical results for the variances in the estimators DD/RR, DD/DR, which turn out to be considerably larger than the common wisdom Poisson estimate and report a small bias in DD/DR in addition to that due to the integral constraint. Further, we introduce and recommend an improved estimator (DD - 2DR + RR)/RR, whose variance is nearly Poisson.

AB  - We present measurements of the redshift-space luminosity-weighted or `marked' correlation function in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These are compared with a model in which the luminosity function and luminosity dependence of clustering are the same as that observed, and in which the form of the luminosity-weighted correlation function is entirely a consequence of the fact that massive haloes populate dense regions. We do this by using mock catalogues which are constrained to reproduce the observed luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of clustering, as well as by using the language of the redshift-space halo model. These analyses show that marked correlations may show a signal on large scales even if there are no large-scale physical effects - the statistical correlation between haloes and their environment will produce a measurable signal. Our model is in good agreement with the measurements, indicating that the halo mass function in dense regions is top heavy; the correlation between halo mass and large-scale environment is the primary driver for correlations between galaxy properties and environment; and the luminosity of the central galaxy in a halo is different from (in general, brighter than) that of the other objects in the halo. Thus our measurement provides strong evidence for the accuracy of these three standard assumptions of galaxy formation models. These assumptions also form the basis of current halo-model-based interpretations of galaxy clustering.  When the same galaxies are weighted by their u-, g- or r-band luminosities, then the marked correlation function is stronger in the redder bands. When the weight is galaxy colour rather than luminosity, then the data suggest that close pairs of galaxies tend to have redder colours. This wavelength dependence of marked correlations is in qualitative agreement with galaxy formation models, and reflects the fact that the mean luminosity of galaxies in a halo depends more strongly on halo mass in the r-band than in u. The luminosity and colour dependence we find are consistent with models in which the galaxy population in clusters is more massive than the population in the field. If the u-band luminosity is a reliable tracer of star formation, then our results suggest that cluster galaxies have lower star formation rates. The virtue of this measurement of environmental trends is that it does not require classification of galaxies into field, group and cluster environments.

AB  - This paper considers the techniques to distinguish normal star-forming (NSF) galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) hosts using optical spectra. The observational data base is a set of 20000 galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, for which we have determined the emission-line intensities after subtracting the stellar continuum obtained from spectral synthesis. Our analysis is based on photoionization models computed using the stellar ionizing radiation predicted by population synthesis codes (essentially STARBURST99) and, for the AGNs, a broken power-law spectrum. We explain why, among the four classical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, ([OIII]/Hbeta versus [OII]/Hbeta, [OIII]/Hbeta versus [NII]/Halpha (the BPT diagram), [OIII]/Hbeta versus [SII]/Halpha and [OIII]/Hbeta versus [OI]/Halpha), the BPT one works best. We show, however, that none of these diagrams is efficient in detecting AGNs in metal-poor galaxies, should such cases exist. We propose a new divisory line between `pure' NSF galaxies and AGN hosts: y = (-30.787 + 1.1358x + 0.27297x2) tanh (5.7409x) - 31.093, where y = log([OIII]/Hbeta), and x = log([NII]/Halpha). According to our models, the divisory line drawn empirically by Kauffmann et al. includes among NSF galaxies objects that may have an AGN contribution to Hbeta of up to 3 per cent. The Kewley et al. line allows for an AGN contribution of roughly 20 per cent. About 20 per cent of the galaxies in our entire sample that can be represented in the BTP diagram are found between our divisory line and the Kauffmann et al. line, meaning that the local Universe contains a fair proportion of galaxies with a very low-level nuclear activity, in agreement with the statistics from observations of nuclei of nearby galaxies. We also show that a classification into NSF and AGN galaxies using only [NII]/Halpha is feasible and useful.  Finally, we propose a new classification diagram, the DEW diagram, plotting Dn(4000) versus max(EW[OII], EW[NeIII]). This diagram can be used with optical spectra for galaxies with redshifts up to z = 1.3, meaning an important progress over classifications proposed up to now. Since the DEW diagram requires only a small range in wavelength, it can also be used at even larger redshifts in suitable atmospheric windows. It also has the advantage of not requiring stellar synthesis analysis to subtract the stars and of allowing one to see all the galaxies in the same diagram, including passive galaxies.

AB  - The classification of galaxies as star forming or active is generally done in the ([OIII]/Hbeta, [NII]/Halpha) plane. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has revealed that, in this plane, the distribution of galaxies looks like the two wings of a seagull. Galaxies in the right wing are referred to as Seyfert/LINERs, leading to the idea that non-stellar activity in galaxies is a very common phenomenon. Here, we argue that a large fraction of the systems in the right wing could actually be galaxies which stopped forming stars. The ionization in these `retired' galaxies would be produced by hot post-asymptotic giant branch stars and white dwarfs. Our argumentation is based on a stellar population analysis of the galaxies via our STARLIGHT code and on photoionization models using the Lyman continuum radiation predicted for this population. The proportion of LINER galaxies that can be explained in such a way is, however, uncertain. We further show how observational selection effects account for the shape of the right wing. Our study suggests that nuclear activity may not be as common as thought. If retired galaxies do explain a large part of the seagull's right wing, some of the work concerning nuclear activity in galaxies, as inferred from SDSS data, will have to be revised.

AB  - Using a catalog of 147,986 galaxy redshifts and fluxes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we measure the galaxy luminosity density at z=0.1 in five optical bandpasses corresponding to the SDSS bandpasses shifted to match their rest-frame shape at z=0.1. We denote the bands 0.1u, 0.1g, 0.1r, 0.1i, 0.1z with lambdaeff=(3216,4240,5595,6792,8111Å), respectively. To estimate the luminosity function, we use a maximum likelihood method that allows for a general form for the shape of the luminosity function, fits for simple luminosity and number evolution, incorporates the flux uncertainties, and accounts for the flux limits of the survey. We find luminosity densities at z=0.1 expressed in absolute AB magnitudes in a Mpc3 to be (-14.10+/-0.15, -15.18+/-0.03, -15.90+/-0.03, -16.24+/-0.03, -16.56+/-0.02) in (0.1u, 0.1g, 0.1r, 0.1i,  0.1z), respectively, for a cosmological model with Omega0=0.3, OmegaLambda=0.7, and h=1 and using SDSS Petrosian magnitudes. Similar results are obtained using Sérsic model magnitudes, suggesting that flux from outside the Petrosian apertures is not a major correction. In the 0.1r band, the best-fit Schechter function to our results has phi*=(1.49+/-0.04)×10-2 h3 Mpc-3, M*-5log10h=-20.44+/-0.01, and alpha=-1.05+/-0.01. In solar luminosities, the luminosity density in 0.1r is (1.84+/-0.04)×108 h L0.1r,solar Mpc-3. Our results in the 0.1g band are consistent with other estimates of the luminosity density, from the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Millennium Galaxy Catalog. They represent a substantial change (~0.5 mag) from earlier SDSS luminosity density results based on commissioning data, almost entirely because of the inclusion of evolution in the luminosity function model.  Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

AB  - We present the first measurements of clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy redshift survey. Our sample consists of 29,300 galaxies with redshifts 5700kms-1<=cz<=39,000kms-1, distributed in several long but narrow (2.5d-5$\,^\circ$) segments, covering 690 deg2. For the full, flux-limited sample, the redshift-space correlation length is approximately 8 h-1 Mpc. The two-dimensional correlation function xi(rp,pi) shows clear signatures of both the small-scale, ``fingers-of-God'' distortion caused by velocity dispersions in collapsed objects and the large-scale compression caused by coherent flows, though the latter cannot be measured with high precision in the present sample. The inferred real-space correlation function is well described by a power law, xi(r)=(r/6.1+/-0.2h-1Mpc)-1.75+/-0.03, for 0.1h-1Mpc<=r<=16h-1Mpc. The galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion is sigma12~600+/-100kms-1 for projected separations 0.15h-1Mpc<=rp<=5h-1Mpc. When we divide the sample by color, the red galaxies exhibit a stronger and steeper real-space correlation function and a higher pairwise velocity dispersion than do the blue galaxies. The relative behavior of subsamples defined by high/low profile concentration or high/low surface brightness is qualitatively similar to that of the red/blue subsamples. Our most striking result is a clear measurement of scale-independent luminosity bias at r<~10h-1Mpc: subsamples with absolute magnitude ranges centered on M*-1.5, M*, and M*+1.5 have real-space correlation functions that are parallel power laws of slope ~-1.8 with correlation lengths of approximately 7.4, 6.3, and 4.7 h-1 Mpc, respectively.

AB  - We present an analysis of a large sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) environments at z ~ 1 using stacked Spitzer data at 3.6mum. The sample contains type 1 and type 2 AGN in the form of quasars and radio galaxies, and spans a large range in both optical and radio luminosity. We find, on average, that two to three massive galaxies containing a substantial evolved stellar population lie within a 200-300kpc radius of the AGN, constituting a >8sigma excess relative to the field. Secondly, we find evidence for the environmental source density to increase with the radio luminosity of AGN, but not with black hole mass. This is shown first by dividing the AGN into their classical AGN types, where we see more significant overdensities in the fields of the radio-loud AGN. If instead we dispense with the classical AGN definitions, we find that the source overdensity as a function of radio luminosity for all our AGN exhibits a positive correlation. One interpretation of this result is that the Mpc-scale environment is in some way influencing the radio emission that we observe from AGN. This could be explained by the confinement of radio jets in dense environments leading to enhance radio emission or, alternatively, may be linked to more rapid black hole spin brought on by galaxy mergers.

AB  - Gravitational interactions between galaxies are widely believed to be the principal mechanism responsible for triggering non-thermal activity in galactic nuclei. We investigate the connection between interacting galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the local universe by comparing the clustering properties of their environments on 0.5 Mpc scales, as quantified by the amplitude of the spatial cross-correlation function. If a direct evolutionary relationship exists, the samples should be situated in environments that are statistically similar. It was previously found that a sample of 33 Seyfert galaxies with z <= 0.05 is located in environments comparable to those of isolated field galaxies. The analysis presented here reveals that a well-matched sample of 52 strongly interacting galaxy systems are preferentially situated in regions more consistent with an Abell Richness Class between 0 and 1. The apparent dissimilarity in the environments thus provides a strong argument against a causal link between major galaxy interactions and Seyfert activity. In contrast, we find that the environments of luminous quasars with z <= 1 exhibit a range of richness levels that are more consistent with the interacting galaxies, suggesting that these objects could be triggered by interactions. Together the results presented here indicate that the relative importance of different mechanisms in initiating nuclear activity may vary with AGN luminosity.

AB  - Using photometric catalogs from wide-field CCD images, we derive the cluster-galaxy correlation amplitudes, B_gc, for 47 low-redshift Abell clusters. We apply a number of tests to establish the robustness of the B_gc parameter as a quantitative measure of richness of galaxy clusters. These include using different galaxy luminosity functions to normalize the excess galaxy counts, counting galaxies to different absolute magnitude limits, and counting galaxies to different cluster-centric radii. These tests show that with a properly normalized luminosity function, the B_gc parameter is relatively insensitive (at better than 1/2 of an Abell richness class) to magnitude limit, areal coverage, and photometric errors of up to about 0.25 mag. We compare the B_gc-values to both the Abell richness class (ARC) and Abell count numbers (N_A). It is found that there is a good correlation between B_gc and N_A for Abell clusters with z<~0.1, with a dispersion of about 1 ARC, whereas the Abell richness classifications for Abell clusters at z>~0.1 are much less well correlated with the true cluster richness. We also find evidence that the richness of ARC>=3 clusters has the tendency of being overestimated in the Abell catalog.

AB  - The spatial cluster-galaxy correlation amplitude, Bgc, is computed for a set of 76 z<0.3 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) from the 1 Jy sample. The Bgc parameter is used to quantify the richness of the environment within 0.5 Mpc of each ULIRG. We find that the environment of local ULIRGs is similar to that of the field with the possible exceptions of a few objects with environmental densities typical of clusters with Abell richness classes 0 and 1. No obvious trends are seen with redshift, optical spectral type, infrared luminosity, or infrared color (f25/f60). We compare these results with those of local AGNs and QSOs at various redshifts. The 1 Jy ULIRGs show a broader range of environments than local Seyferts, which are exclusively found in the field. The distribution of ULIRG Bgc-values overlaps considerably with that of local QSOs, consistent with the scenario where some QSOs go through a ultraluminous infrared phase. However, a rigorous statistical analysis of the data indicates that these two samples are not drawn from the same parent population. The Bgc distribution of QSOs shows a distinct tail at high Bgc-values, which is not apparent among the ULIRGs. This difference is consistent with the fact that some of the QSOs used for this comparison have bigger and more luminous hosts than the 1 Jy ULIRGs.

AB  - The paper `The cluster environments of powerful radio galaxies', by Richard M. Prestage and John A. Peacock was published in Mon. Not. R. astr. Soc., (1988) 230, 131-160. There was an error in the function H(z) used in this paper, which was too large by a factor (180/pi)^2-gamma^. Consequently, all quoted values of B_gg*_ (Tables 5-7) are too small and should be increased by this same factor which amounts to 2.537 for the adopted value of gamma=1.77. The value for B_gg_ is similarly affected; however, there was an additional error in the computer program which converted between A_gg_ and B_gg_. This increased the B_gg_. value by a factor of almost exactly 2, approximately cancelling the effect of the above error in H(z). After these corrections, the value of B_gg_ deduced from the Lick counts becomes 51. Thus, the values of B_gg*_/B_gg_ (Table 4) are too small and should be doubled. The discussion of the richness of radio galaxy environments remains unaltered. B_gg*_ values for Abell clusters were evaluated using the same method as for the radio galaxies, so the above global scaling factors do not affect the richness values inferred for the radio galaxies.

Lick galaxy counts for z of less than 0.1 are extended to z of less than 0.25 using deep galaxy samples from UK Schmidt plates. Although the low-luminosity Fanaroff-Riley class I sources lie in richer clusters than those of class II, a real scatter in properties is found. The results show no statistical evidence for the difference in environment suggested to exist between different subclasses of the class II sources. Compact radio sources are found to lie in regions of low galactic density.

The K-corrections are reviewed with available UV data, and the necessary assumptions and model input parameters. In particular the possibility that the bulges of spiral galaxies have evolved in a form similar to that expected for elliptical galaxies is explored. The inclusion of bulge evolution predicts significantly more galaxies and may be consistent with the steepening count-magnitude slope at faint magnitudes. A significant fraction of Bj = 23 galaxies could be luminous compact objects with redshifts greater than 1 seen during their epoch of rapid star formation.

AB  - Images centered on 108 quasars with redshifts between 0.05 and 2.05 were obtained using the direct-SIT camera on the Palomar 1.52 m telescope. This paper presents the analyzed data without a priori assumptions about the nature of quasar redshifts and shows that the results are consistent with the hypothesis that quasars are associated with galaxies at the cosmological distances implied by the quasar redshifts. By assuming that quasars are at their cosmological redshift distances, some of the physical properties of the groups and clusters that are apparently associated with the quasars are derived. Marginally significant differences were found between the environments of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars.

AB  - The OPERA neutrino experiment at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory has measured the velocity of neutrinos from the CERN CNGS beam over a baseline of about 730 km with much higher accuracy than previous studies conducted with accelerator neutrinos. The measurement is based on high-statistics data taken by OPERA in the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Dedicated upgrades of the CNGS timing system and of the OPERA detector, as well as a high precision geodesy campaign for the measurement of the neutrino baseline, allowed reaching comparable systematic and statistical accuracies. An early arrival time of CNGS muon neutrinos with respect to the one computed assuming the speed of light in vacuum of (60.7 \pm 6.9 (stat.) \pm 7.4 (sys.)) ns was measured. This anomaly corresponds to a relative difference of the muon neutrino velocity with respect to the speed of light (v-c)/c = (2.48 \pm 0.28 (stat.) \pm 0.30 (sys.)) \times 10-5.

AB  - The radio-source distribution in the 4C catalog is analyzed by the techniques used in previous papers in this series. The cross correlation between source positions and Lick galaxy counts is measured in some detail. There is weak but apparently significant clustering among the sources themselves on scales of a few degrees. The observed variation of cross correlation with flux level shows that the differential radio luminosity function at the weak power end varies approximately as the -1.3 power of radio power. The statistics are interpreted in terms of source-galaxy and source-source spatial correlation functions that have the same shape as the galaxy-galaxy function but amplitudes larger by factors 10.4 and 142. That is, 4C sources are not associated with galaxies at random, but rather tend to be found among strongly clustered galaxies.

AB  - In this first paper of a series on the structure of boxy and peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulges, Kn-band observations of a sample of 30 edge-on spiral galaxies are described and discussed. Kn-band observations best trace the dominant luminous galactic mass and are minimally affected by dust. Images, unsharp-masked images, as well as major-axis and vertically summed surface brightness profiles are presented and discussed. Galaxies with a B/PS bulge tend to have a more complex morphology than galaxies with other bulge types, more often showing centred or off-centred X structures, secondary maxima along the major-axis and spiral-like structures. While probably not uniquely related to bars, those features are observed in three-dimensional N-body simulations of barred discs and may trace the main bar orbit families. The surface brightness profiles of galaxies with a B/PS bulge are also more complex, typically containing three or more clearly separated regions, including a shallow or flat intermediate region (Freeman Type II profiles). The breaks in the profiles offer evidence for bar-driven transfer of angular momentum and radial redistribution of material. The profiles further suggest a rapid variation of the scaleheight of the disc material, contrary to conventional wisdom but again as expected from the vertical resonances and instabilities present in barred discs. Interestingly, the steep inner region of the surface brightness profiles is often shorter than the isophotally thick part of the galaxies, itself always shorter than the flat intermediate region of the profiles. The steep inner region is also much more prominent along the major-axis than in the vertically summed profiles. Similarly to other recent work but contrary to the standard `bulge + disc' model (where the bulge is both thick and steep), we thus propose that galaxies with a B/PS bulge are composed of a thin concentrated disc (a disc-like bulge) contained within a partially thick bar (the B/PS bulge), itself contained within a thin outer disc. The inner disc likely formed secularly through bar-driven processes and is responsible for the steep inner region of the surface brightness profiles, traditionally associated with a classic bulge, while the bar is responsible for the flat intermediate region of the surface brightness profiles and the thick complex morphological structures observed. Those components are strongly coupled dynamically and are formed mostly of the same (disc) material, shaped by the weak but relentless action of the bar resonances. Any competing formation scenario for galaxies with a B/PS bulge, which represent at least 45 per cent of the local disc galaxy population, must explain equally well and self-consistently the above morphological and photometric properties, the complex gas and stellar kinematics observed, and the correlations between them.

AB  - We present a classification for bulges of a complete sample of ~ 1350 edge-on disk galaxies derived from the RC3 (Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, de Vaucouleurs et al. rc3). A visual classification of the bulges using the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) in three types of b/p bulges or as an elliptical type is presented and supported by CCD images. NIR observations reveal that dust extinction does almost not influence the shape of bulges. There is no substantial difference between the shape of bulges in the optical and in the NIR. Our analysis reveals that 45% of all bulges are box- and peanut-shaped (b/p). The frequency of b/p bulges for all morphological types from S0 to Sd is > 40%. In particular, this is for the first time that such a large frequency of b/p bulges is reported for galaxies as late as Sd. The fraction of the observed b/p bulges is large enough to explain the b/p bulges by bars. Partly based on observations collected at ESO/La Silla (Chile), DSAZ/Calar Alto (Spain), and Lowell Observatory/Flagstaff (AZ/U.S.A.).

AB  - This note documents the methods used by the smartphone application, "GalMass," which has been released on the Android Market. GalMass estimates the halo virial mass (Mvir), stellar mass (Mstar), gas mass (Mgas), and galaxy gas fraction of a central galaxy as a function of redshift (z<2), with any one of the above masses as an input parameter. In order to convert between Mvir and Mstar (in either direction), GalMass uses fitting functions that approximate the abundance matching models of either Conroy & Wechsler (2009), Moster et al. (2010), or Behroozi et al. (2010). GalMass uses a a semi-empirical fit to observed galaxy gas fractions to convert between Mstar and Mgas, as outlined in Stewart et al. (2009).

It thus provides the opportunity to assemble a very large number of images, obtained by amateur observers all along the path, into a continuous record of coronal evolution in time; totality lasts for an hour and a half over the continental U.S. While we describe this event here as an opportunity for public education and outreach, such a movie -with very high time resolution and extending to the chromosphere - will also contain unprecedented information about the physics of the solar corona.

AB  - Clustering of galaxies about extragalactic radio sources is investigated by cross correlating the radio positions of 3CR and 4C sources with the positions of Zwicky galaxies and galaxies included in Lick counts. The cross-correlation functions are used to determine a linear clustering scale that ranges from galaxies selected at random in the universe to rich clusters of galaxies. It is found that: (1) the cross-correlation function for galaxies about radio sources has the same form as the galaxy-galaxy autocorrelation function on angular scales less than 1.5 deg of arc; (2) very weak radio galaxies show no tendency to belong to groups or clusters of galaxies; (3) on the average, extended powerful radio sources are observed in regions of space where the amplitude of the spatial cross-correlation function is about four to five times that of galaxies selected at random; (4) classical double sources with strong emission-line spectra have a cross-correlation function with galaxies similar to that of randomly selected galaxies; and (5) complex radio sources associated with galaxies having only an absorption-line spectrum or a weak emission spectrum belong to groups and clusters of galaxies.

AB  - We present direct imaging data of the fields of BL Lac objects drawn from the complete 1 Jy sample. An increase in galaxy surface density towards the BL Lac objects in subsamples with mean redshifts 0.28 and 0.65 is found. The covariance amplitudes 215 and 515 correspond roughly to galaxy clusters of richness classes 0 and 1, respectively. Similar covariance amplitudes have been found for radio galaxies; our result therefore can be naturally understood if the BL Lac phenomenon is due to relativistic beaming, i.e. the BL Lac objects are FRI radio galaxies with the jet pointing towards us. In contrast, a constant galaxy surface density is found for the subsample with mean redshift 0.97. This would also be expected under the beaming hypothesis, since cluster galaxies at z roughly 1 would be well below our detection limit. However, since at least in one case we find strong evidence for gravitational lensing, we suggest that the high redshift BL Lac objects are not a homogeneous class of objects, but rather contain both beamed and lensed objects.

AB  - We analyse the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology and colour with two-point clustering statistics, using data from the Galaxy Zoo, the largest sample of visually classified morphologies yet compiled, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We present two-point correlation functions of spiral and early-type galaxies, and we quantify the correlation between morphology and environment with marked correlation functions. These yield clear and precise environmental trends across a wide range of scales, analogous to similar measurements with galaxy colours, indicating that the Galaxy Zoo classifications themselves are very precise. We measure morphology marked correlation functions at fixed colour and find that they are relatively weak, with the only residual correlation being that of red galaxies at small scales, indicating a morphology gradient within haloes for red galaxies. At fixed morphology, we find that the environmental dependence of colour remains strong, and these correlations remain for fixed morphology and luminosity. An implication of this is that much of the morphology-density relation is due to the relation between colour and density. Our results also have implications for galaxy evolution: the morphological transformation of galaxies is usually accompanied by a colour transformation, but not necessarily vice versa. A spiral galaxy may move on to the red sequence of the colour-magnitude diagram without quickly becoming an early type. We analyse the significant population of red spiral galaxies, and present evidence that they tend to be located in moderately dense environments and are often satellite galaxies in the outskirts of haloes. Finally, we combine our results to argue that central and satellite galaxies tend to follow different evolutionary paths.  This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 100000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project.

AB  - This paper presents the first results from a new citizen science project: Galaxy Zoo Supernovae. This proof-of-concept project uses members of the public to identify supernova candidates from the latest generation of wide-field imaging transient surveys. We describe the Galaxy Zoo Supernovae operations and scoring model, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel method using imaging data and transients from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). We examine the results collected over the period 2010 April-July, during which nearly 14 000 supernova candidates from the PTF were classified by more than 2500 individuals within a few hours of data collection. We compare the transients selected by the citizen scientists to those identified by experienced PTF scanners and find the agreement to be remarkable - Galaxy Zoo Supernovae performs comparably to the PTF scanners and identified as transients 93 per cent of the ˜130 spectroscopically confirmed supernovae (SNe) that the PTF located during the trial period (with no false positive identifications). Further analysis shows that only a small fraction of the lowest signal-to-noise ratio detections (r > 19.5) are given low scores: Galaxy Zoo Supernovae correctly identifies all SNe with >=8sigma detections in the PTF imaging data. The Galaxy Zoo Supernovae project has direct applicability to future transient searches, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, by both rapidly identifying candidate transient events and via the training and improvement of existing machine classifier algorithms. This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 10 000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo Supernovae project ().

AB  - Following the study of Darg et al., we explore the environments, optical colours, stellar masses, star formation and active galactic nucleus activity in a sample of 3003 pairs of merging galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project. While Darg et al. found that the spiral-to-elliptical ratio in (major) mergers appeared higher than that of the global galaxy population, no significant differences are found between the environmental distributions of mergers and a randomly selected control sample. This makes the high occurrence of spirals in mergers unlikely to be an environmental effect and must therefore arise from differing time-scales of detectability for spirals and ellipticals. We find that merging galaxies have a wider spread in colour than the global galaxy population, with a significant blue tail resulting from intense star formation in spiral mergers. Galaxies classed as star-forming using their emission-line properties have average star formation rates approximately doubled by the merger process though star formation is negligibly enhanced in merging elliptical galaxies. We conclude that the internal properties of galaxies significantly affect the time-scales over which merging systems can be detected (as suggested by recent theoretical studies) which leads to spirals being `over-observed' in mergers. We also suggest that the transition mass 3 × 1010Msolar, noted by Kauffmann et al., below which ellipticals are rare could be linked to disc survival/destruction in mergers.

AB  - Life arose on Earth sometime in the first few hundred million years after the young planet had cooled to the point that it could support water-based organisms on its surface. The early emergence of life on Earth has been taken as evidence that the probability of abiogenesis is high, if starting from young-Earth-like conditions. We revisit this argument quantitatively in a Bayesian statistical framework. By constructing a simple model of the probability of abiogenesis, we calculate a Bayesian estimate of its posterior probability, given the data that life emerged fairly early in Earth's history and that, billions of years later, sentient creatures noted this fact and considered its implications. We find that, given only this very limited empirical information, the choice of Bayesian prior for the abiogenesis probability parameter has a dominant influence on the computed posterior probability. Thus, although life began on this planet fairly soon after the Earth became habitable, this fact is consistent with an arbitrarily low intrinsic probability of abiogenesis for plausible uninformative priors, and therefore with life being arbitrarily rare in the Universe.

AB  - We present 21-cm observations and models of the HI kinematics and distribution of NGC 4244, a nearby edge-on Scd galaxy observed as part of the Westerbork Hydrogen Accretion in LOcal GAlaxieS (HALOGAS) survey. Our models give insight into the HI kinematics and distribution with an emphasis on the potential existence of extra-planar gas as well as a negative gradient in rotational velocity with height above the plane of the disk (a lag). Our models yield strong evidence against a significantly extended halo and instead favor a warp component along the line of sight as an explanation for some of the observed thickening of the disk. Based on these models, we detect a lag of -9 +3/-2 km s-1 kpc-1 in the approaching half and -9 +/-2 km s-1 kpc-1 in the receding half. This lag decreases in magnitude to -5+/-2 km s-1 kpc-1 and -4+/-2 km s-1 kpc-1 near a radius of 10 kpc in the approaching and receding halves respectively. Additionally, we detect several distinct morphological and kinematic features including a shell that is probably driven by star formation within the disk.

Each object is identified by a root name, coded as BZB, BZQ and BZU for these three subclasses respectively, and by its coordinates. This catalogue is being built as a tool useful for the identification of the extragalactic sources that will be detected by present and future experiments for X and gamma-ray astronomy, like Swift, AGILE, Fermi-GLAST and Simbol-X. An electronic version is available from the ASI Science Data Center web site at http://www.asdc.asi.it/bzcat.

AB  - The properties of the host galaxies of a well-defined sample of 2215 radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with redshifts 0.03 < z < 0.3, defined from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), are investigated. These are predominantly low radio-luminosity sources, with 1.4-GHz luminosities in the range 1023-1025 WHz-1. The fraction of galaxies that host radio-loud AGN with L1.4GHz > 1023WHz-1 is a strong function of stellar mass, rising from nearly zero below a stellar mass of 1010Msolar to more than 30 per cent at stellar masses of 5 × 1011Msolar. In contrast to the integrated [OIII] luminosity density from emission-line AGN, which is mainly produced by black holes with masses below 108Msolar, the integrated radio luminosity density comes from the most massive black holes in the Universe. The integral radio luminosity function is derived in six ranges of stellar and black hole masses. Its shape is very similar in all of these ranges and can be well fitted by a broken power law. Its normalization varies strongly with mass, as M2.5* or M1.6BH; this scaling only begins to break down when the predicted radio-loud fraction exceeds 20-30 per cent. There is no correlation between radio and emission-line luminosities for the radio-loud AGN in the sample and the probability that a galaxy of given mass is radio loud is independent of whether it is optically classified as an AGN. The host galaxies of the radio-loud AGN have properties similar to those of ordinary galaxies of the same mass, with a tendency for radio-loud AGN to be found in larger galaxies and in richer environments. The host galaxies of radio-loud AGN with emission lines match those of their radio-quiet counterparts.  All of these findings support the conclusion that the optical AGN and low radio-luminosity AGN phenomena are independent and are triggered by different physical mechanisms. Intriguingly, the dependence on black hole mass of the radio-loud AGN fraction mirrors that of the rate at which gas cools from the hot atmospheres of elliptical galaxies. It is speculated that gas cooling provides a natural explanation for the origin of the radio-loud AGN activity, and it is argued that AGN heating could plausibly balance the cooling of the gas over time.

AB  - We investigate the relationship between black hole mass (MBH) and Doppler boosted emission for BL Lacertae type objects (BL Lacs) detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) surveys. The synthesis of stellar population and two-dimensional decomposition methods allows us to disentangle the components of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in their optical spectra and images, respectively. We derive estimates of black hole masses via stellar velocity dispersion and bulge luminosity. We find that masses delivered by both methods are consistent within errors. There is no difference between the black hole mass ranges for high-synchrotron peaked BL Lacs (HBL) and low-synchrotron peaked BL Lacs (LBL). A correlation between the black hole mass and radio, optical and X-ray luminosity has been found at a high significance level. The optical continuum emission correlates with the jet luminosity as well. Besides, X-ray and radio emission are correlated when HBLs and LBLs are considered separately. Results presented in this work (i) show that the black hole mass does not decide the spectral energy distribution shapes of BL Lacs, (ii) confirm that X-ray and optical emission is associated to the relativistic jet and (iii) present evidence of a relation between MBH and Doppler boosted emission, which among BL Lacs may be understood as a close relation between faster jets and more massive black holes.

AB  - Six BL Lac objects from the complete 1 Jy radio-selected sample of 34 objects were observed in cycle 5 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to an equivalent limiting flux of mu_I~26 mag arcsec^-2. Here we report results for the second half of this sample, as well as new results for the first three objects, discussed previously by Falomo and coworkers. In addition, we have analyzed in the same way HST images of three X-ray-selected BL Lac objects observed by Jannuzi and coworkers. The ensemble of nine BL Lac objects spans the redshift range from z=0.19 to ~1. Host galaxies are clearly detected in seven cases, while the other two, at z~0.258 (redshift highly uncertain) and z=0.997, are not resolved. The HST images make up a homogeneous data set with unprecedented morphological information between a few tenths of an arcsecond and several arcseconds from the nucleus, allowing us to rule out definitively a pure disk light profile in six of the seven detected host galaxies. The host galaxies are luminous ellipticals with an average absolute magnitude of M_I~-24.6 mag (with dispersion 0.7 mag), more than a magnitude brighter than L^* and comparable to the brightest cluster galaxies. The morphologies are generally smooth and have small ellipticities (ε<~0.2). Given such roundness, there is no obvious alignment with the more linear radio structures. In the six cases for which we have HST WFPC2 images in two filters, the derived color profiles show no strong spatial gradients and are as expected for K-corrected passively evolving elliptical galaxies. The host galaxies of the radio-selected and X-ray-selected BL Lac objects for this very limited sample are comparable in both morphology and luminosity.

AB  - The HST snapshot imaging survey of 110 BL Lac objects (Urry et al.) has clearly shown that the host galaxies are massive and luminous ellipticals. The dispersion of the absolute magnitudes is sufficiently small that the measurement of the galaxy brightness becomes a valuable way of estimating their distance. This is illustrated by constructing a Hubble diagram of the 64 resolved objects with known redshift. By means of this relationship, we estimate the redshift of five resolved BL Lac objects of the survey that have no spectroscopic z. The adopted method also allows us to evaluate lower limits to the redshift for 13 objects of still unknown z using the lower limit on the host galaxy magnitude. This technique can be applied to any BL Lac object for which an estimate or a lower limit of the host galaxy magnitude is available. Finally, we show that the distribution of the nuclear luminosity of all the BL Lac objects of the survey indicates that the objects for which both the redshift and the host galaxy are undetected are among the most luminous, and possibly the most highly beamed.

AB  - We present and discuss polarimetric observations of 182 targets drawn from an optically selected sample of 240 probable BL Lac candidates out of the SDSS compiled by Collinge et al. (2005, AJ, 129, 2542). In contrast to most other BL Lac candidate samples extracted from the SDSS, its radio- and/or X-ray properties have not been taken into account for its derivation. Thus, because its selection is based on optical properties alone, it may be less prone to selection effects inherent in other samples derived at different frequencies, so it offers a unique opportunity to extract the first unbiased BL Lac luminosity function that is suitably large in size. We found 124 out of 182 targets (68%) to be polarized, 95 of the polarized targets (77%) to be highly polarized (>4%). The low-frequency peaked BL Lac candidates in the sample are on average only slightly more polarized than the high-frequency peaked ones. Compared to earlier studies, we found a high duty cycle in high polarization (~ 66+2-14% to be >4% polarized) in high-frequency peaked BL Lac candidates. This may come from our polarization analysis, which minimizes the contamination by host galaxy light. No evidence of radio-quiet BL Lac objects in the sample was found. Our observations show that the probable sample of BL Lac candidates of Collinge et al. (2005) indeed contains a large number of bona fide BL Lac objects. High S/N spectroscopy and deep X-ray observations are required to construct the first luminosity function of optically selected BL Lac objects and to test more stringently for any radio-quiet BL Lac objects in the sample.

AB  - A sample of 2712 radio-luminous galaxies is defined from the second data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) by cross-comparing the main spectroscopic galaxy sample with two radio surveys: the National Radio Astronomy Observatories (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS) and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST) survey. The comparison is carried out in a multistage process and makes optimal use of both radio surveys by exploiting the sensitivity of the NVSS to extended and multicomponent radio sources in addition to the high angular resolution of the FIRST images. A radio source sample with 95 per cent completeness and 98.9 per cent reliability is achieved, far better than would be possible for this sample if only one of the surveys was used. The radio source sample is then divided into two classes: radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies in which the radio emission is dominated by star formation. The division is based on the location of a galaxy in the plane of 4000-Åbreak strength versus radio luminosity per unit stellar mass and provides a sample of 2215 radio-loud AGN and 497 star-forming galaxies brighter than 5mJy at 1.4GHz. A full catalogue of positions and radio properties is provided for these sources. The local radio luminosity function is then derived both for radio-loud AGN and for star-forming galaxies and is found to be in agreement with previous studies. By using the radio to far-infrared (FIR) correlation, the radio luminosity function of star-forming galaxies is also compared to the luminosity function derived in the FIR. It is found to agree well at high luminosities but less so at lower luminosities, confirming that the linearity of the radio to FIR correlation breaks down below about 1022 WHz-1 at 1.4GHz.

AB  - We have undertaken a survey, the Deep X-Ray Radio Blazar Survey (DXRBS), of archived, pointed ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter data for blazars by correlating the ROSAT WGACAT database with several publicly available radio catalogs, restricting our candidate list to serendipitous flat radio spectrum sources (alpha_r <= 0.70, where S_nu ~ nu^-alpha_r . We discuss our survey methods, identification procedure, and first results. Our survey is found to be ~95% efficient at finding flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars (FSRQs; 59 of our first 85 identifications) and BL Lacertae objects (22 of our first 85 identifications), a figure that is comparable to or greater than that achieved by other radio and X-ray survey techniques. The identifications presented here show that all previous samples of blazars (even when taken together) did not representatively survey the blazar population, missing critical regions of (L_X, L_R) parameter space within which large fractions of the blazar population lie. Particularly important is the identification of a large population of FSRQs (>~25% of DXRBS FSRQs) with ratios of X-ray to radio luminosity >~10^-6 (alpha_rx <~ 0.78). In addition, as a result of our greater sensitivity, the DXRBS has already more than doubled the number of FSRQs in complete samples with 5 GHz (radio) luminosities between 10^31.5 and 10^33.5 ergs s^-1 Hz^-1, and fills in the region of parameter space between X-ray-selected and radio-selected samples of BL Lac objects. The DXRBS is the very first sample to contain statistically significant numbers of blazars at low luminosities, approaching what should be the lower end of the FSRQ luminosity function. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile; Kitt Peak National Observatory; Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory; and the Australia Telescope National Facility.

AB  - We have searched the archived, pointed ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter data for blazars by correlating the WGACAT X-ray data base with several publicly available radio catalogues, restricting our candidate list to serendipitous X-ray sources with a flat radio spectrum (alphar<=0.70, where Snu~nu-alpha). This makes up the Deep X-ray Radio Blazar Survey (DXRBS). Here we present new identifications and spectra for 106 sources, including 86 radio-loud quasars, 11 BL Lacertae objects, and nine narrow-line radio galaxies. Together with our previously published objects and already-known sources, our sample now contains 298 identified objects: 234 radio-loud quasars [181 flat-spectrum quasars: FSRQ (alphar<=0.50) and 53 steep-spectrum quasars: SSRQ], 36 BL Lacs and 28 narrow-line radio galaxies. Redshift information is available for 96 per cent of these. Thus our selection technique is ~90 per cent efficient at finding radio-loud quasars and BL Lacs. Reaching 5-GHz radio fluxes ~50mJy and 0.1-2.0keV X-ray fluxes a few ×10-14ergcm-2s-1, DXRBS is the faintest and largest flat-spectrum radio sample with nearly complete (~85 per cent) identification. We review the properties of the DXRBS blazar sample, including redshift distribution and coverage of the X-ray-radio-power plane for quasars and BL Lacs. Additionally, we touch upon the expanded multiwavelength view of blazars provided by DXRBS. By sampling for the first time the faint end of the radio and X-ray luminosity functions, this sample will allow us to investigate the blazar phenomenon and the validity of unified schemes down to relatively low powers.

AB  - Our knowledge of the blazar surface densities and luminosity functions, which are fundamental parameters, relies still on samples at relatively high flux limits. As a result, our understanding of this rare class of active galactic nuclei is mostly based on relatively bright and intrinsically luminous sources. We present the radio number counts, evolutionary properties, and luminosity functions of the faintest blazar sample with basically complete (~95%) identifications. Based on the Deep X-Ray Radio Blazar Survey (DXRBS), it includes 129 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and 24 BL Lac objects down to a 5 GHz flux and power ~50 mJy and ~1024 W Hz-1, respectively, an order of magnitude improvement as compared to previously published (radio-selected) blazar samples. DXRBS FSRQs are seen to evolve strongly, up to redshift ~1.5, above which high-power sources show a decline in their comoving space density. DXRBS BL Lac objects, on the other hand, do not evolve. High-energy and low-energy peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs and LBLs, respectively) share the same lack of cosmological evolution, which is at variance with some previous results. The observed luminosity functions are in good agreement with the predictions of unified schemes, with FSRQs getting close to their expected minimum power. Despite the fact that the large majority of our blazars are FSRQs, BL Lac objects are intrinsically ~50 times more numerous. Finally, the relative numbers of HBLs and LBLs in the radio and X-ray bands are different from those predicted by the so-called blazar sequence and support a scenario in which HBLs represent a small minority (~10%) of all BL Lac objects.

AB  - Multiobject spectroscopy of galaxies associated with optically luminous quasars with z in the range of 0.15 to 0.6 is presented. The relative radial velocities of galaxies within 500 kpc of the quasars seem to be well described by a Gaussian distribution with a dispersion of 400-500 km/s. This result is independent of whether the quasar is radio-loud or radio-quiet, and, more surprisingly, whether it is located in a rich cluster of galaxies or in a poor group. Comparison with galaxy cluster dynamics for different environments indicates that the rich clusters of galaxies associated with quasars have anomalously low velocity dispersions, whereas the poor groups of galaxies may be dynamically normal. This result is consistent with models of quasar formation triggered by galaxy-galaxy interaction, where the efficiency of such interactions is much greater for low relative velocities.

AB  - An analysis is performed of the evolution of quasar/AGN activity in rich clusters by combining samples of both radio-loud quasars (RLQs) and radio galaxies. Using data from the literature, the optical luminosity function (LF) of radio-loud quasars is modeled, and the model is used to study the LF evolution and its dependence on cluster environment. It is demonstrated that low-redshift radio galaxies and optically bright RLQs at higher redshift may form a single-parameter family. The level of activity in radio galaxies at the current epoch is consistent with the extrapolation of the evolution of RLQs. It is also shown that, if RLQs in all environments have the same bright-end LF slope, then AGNs in rich galaxy clusters evolve 5-6 times more rapidly than those in poor environments. By studying the properties of environments hosting a wide range of AGN activity, the dominant environmental parameters important for the occurrence of quasar activity can be determined.

AB  - It is shown here that the environments of radio-loud quasars have a strong effect on the optical evolution of the quasars. Quasars in rich clusters of galaxies are found to fade at least four optical magnitudes between redshifts 0.65 and 0.3, corresponding to a statistical e-folding fading time of about 1.0 Gyr. This rapid decrease in quasar activity is about four times as fast as quasars in poor environments. Several physical mechanisms of this evolution are suggested, emphasizing dynamical evolution of the cluster core and evolution in the amount of gaseous fuel in the cluster environment. The environments of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars are shown to be significantly different. Radio-quiet quasars are much less frequently situated in galaxy clusters as rich as Abell class I. This result is consistent with scenarios linking radio-loud quasars with elliptical host galaxies and radio-quiet quasars with spiral host galaxies.

AB  - The results of an extensive imaging survey of BL Lac objects conducted at the Canada-France-Hawaii 3.6 m Telescope (CFHT) are presented. This paper details the results pertinent to the clustering environments of BL Lacs; a companion paper (Wurtz, Stocke, & Yee) presented results on the host galaxies of BL Lacs obtained from the same Gunn r-band images. The clustering environments of BL Lac objects in this survey are on average found to be poor clusters, comparable in galaxy density to Abell richness class <0. Using the formalism developed by Longair & Seldner and the specific techniques employed by Yee & Green, a mean value for the galaxy--BL Lac two-point correlation function amplitude was found to be <Bgb> = 209 Mpc1.77 +/- 386 (mean +/-1 sigma spread for H0 = 50 km s-1 Mpc-1 and q0 = 0.02). Only a few (at most six of 45) BL Lacs in this sample are found in clusters with richness class >1, and most of these are at z > 0.4. Various subsamples of BL Lacs with unique qualities (e.g., presence/absence of weak emission lines, high/low optical core dominance or polarization, X-ray vs. radio-selected, etc.) have statistically similar clustering properties, which further argues that these BL Lacs are all members of the same active galactic nucleus (AGN) class. However, we do find that, like radio-loud quasars, BL Lac environments are significantly richer at high redshift (for z > 0.35, the median Bgb = 500 Mpc1.77 compared to a median Bgb = 120 Mpc1.77 at lower z). Correlations are also found between Bgb and host galaxy luminosity and radio core dominance. Contrary to the expectations of unification schemes for BL Lacs, the clustering environments of BL Lacs, at both high and low redshift, are more similar to those of FR 2 radio galaxies and quasars than to those of FR 1's. Approximately 20% of low-z FR 1's are in richer clusters than almost all low-z BL Lacs (PKS 0548-322 is the lone exception of a BL Lac in a rich cluster); similarly, 20% of FR 1's have more luminous host galaxies than any BL Lac (Paper I). This new line of evidence strongly suggests that the unification scenario for BL Lacs with FR 1 radio galaxies requires a critical reexamination. As a minimum the "parent population" of BL Lacs must be modified to exclude the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in rich clusters at low redshift. The great similarity in the cosmic evolution of the cluster environment for radio-loud quasars, FR 2 radio galaxies, and BL Lac objects between z ~ 0.5 and 0 strongly suggests that a common physical mechanism operates to create a rapid luminosity evolution for AGNs in rich clusters. Since X-ray observations find rapid cosmic evolution in the intracluster medium and cluster potential well over similar timescales, the rapidly changing gas density and/or galaxy-galaxy interaction rate could be responsible for the fading of luminous AGNs in rich clusters (Stocke & Perrenod; Roos).

AB  - Multislit spectroscopy and three-color CCD photometry of the galaxies in the cluster associated with the quasar 3C 206 (PKS 0837-12) at z = 0.198 are presented. This cluster is the richest environment of any low-redshift quasar observed in an Abell richness class 1 cluster. The cluster has a very flattened structure and a very concentrated core about the quasar. Most of the galaxies in this field have colors and luminosities consistent with normal galaxies at this redshift. The background-corrected blue fraction of galaxies is consistent with values for other rich clusters. The existence of several blue galaxies in the concentrated cluster core is an anomaly for a region of such high galaxy density, however, suggesting the absence of a substantial intracluster medium. This claim is supported by the Fanaroff-Riley (1974) class II morphology of the radio source. The velocity dispersion calculated from 11 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members is 500 + or - 110 km/s, which is slightly lower than the average for Abell class 1 clusters. A high frequency of interaction between the quasar host galaxy and cluster core members at low relative velocities, and a low intracluster gas pressure, may comprise a favorable environment for quasar activity. The properties of the cluster of galaxies associated with 3C 206 are consistent with this model.

AB  - Aims.We present optical spectroscopy for a sample of BL Lac objects, to determine their redshift, to study their broad emission line properties, and to characterize their close environment. Methods: .Twelve objects were observed using the ESO 3.6 m and NOT 2.5 m telescopes, obtaining spectra for the BL Lacs and for nearby sources. Results: .For seven of these objects, nuclear emission lines and/or absorption lines from the host galaxy were detected. In all the four cases where absorption lines were revealed, the host galaxy has been resolved with HST or ground-based imaging. The broad Halpha luminosities (or their upper limits) of the BL Lacs are similar to those of radio-loud quasars. For two BL Lacs, spectroscopy of close companions indicates that they are at the redshift of the BL Lacs, and therefore physically associated and probably interacting. Five BL Lacs have a featureless spectrum. In these cases, we apply a new technique to derive lower limits for their redshift, which are consistent with the lower limits deduced from imaging.

AB  - We report measurements of the amplitude of the BL Lac galaxy spatial covariance function, B(gb), for the fields of five BL Lacertae objects. We present evidence for rich clusters around MS 1207+39 and MS 1407+59, and confirm high richness for the cluster containing H0414+009. We discuss the ease of 3C 66 A and find evidence for a poor cluster based on an uncertain redshift of z = 0.444. These data suggest that at least some BL Lac objects are consistent with being FR 1 radio galaxies in rich clusters.

AB  - High-resolution R-band images for 16 BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects are reported. The data allow the author to study the properties of the host galaxies and the close environment with sub-arcsec resolution. The author is able to detect the surrounding nebulosity for 11 sources, while four remain unresolved. One case (0235+164) is complex and it is considered in detail. The author discusses the average properties of host galaxies, including a number of objects previously investigated with the same instrumentation and analysis procedure. It is found that in all studied cases, the host galaxies are elliptical or bulge-dominated systems. Although for some objects the presence of a disc galaxy cannot be ruled out, there are no convincing justifications for preferring disc rather than elliptical models. The average absolute magnitude of host galaxies is MR= -23.5 (H0= 50 km s-1kpc-1 and q0= 0). For six objects the author has detected companions, which are often resolved and are located at a projected distance from the BL Lac object of about 10-40 kpc. This gives support to the idea that interactions may be important to the BL Lac phenomenon, and is consistent with the finding that many BL Lacs are located in groups of galaxies.

AB  - We analyze images of BL Lacertae objects obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 and the F814W filter. The nine objects cover a redshift range of 0.19 to 0.997. The relatively deep images are sufficient to detect galaxies at least one magnitude below MI* (-21.4) and in most cases to three magnitudes below M*. Galaxy enhancement over the average background is found around four out of the nine objects. Results for some cases are confirmed by ground-based imaging. In the other cases, the redshifts of the target BL Lac objects may be incorrect or they are truly isolated. These findings reinforce the idea that on average, BL Lac objects are found in regions of above average galaxy density. However, isolated objects apparently can host BL Lac nuclei too, a result that has implications for the processes that trigger/fuel the nuclear activity.

AB  - We report on direct, subarcsecond resolution imaging of the nebulosity and spectroscopy of galaxies in the field of the BL Lacertae object PKS 0548-322. Surface photometry of the nebulosity is used to derive the properties of the host galaxy (MV = -23.4), which exhibits signs of interaction with a close companion galaxy at approximately 25 kpc. The radial brightness profile of the nebulosity is well fitted by the contribution of a bulge (r1/4) plus a point source and a small internal disk. An analysis of the galaxies in the field shows that the source is located in a rich cluster of galaxies. Spectra of five galaxies in the field indicate that they are at the same redshift as the BL Lac object, thus supporting the imaging result of a surrounding cluster associated with the BL Lac. This cluster is most likely Abell S0549.

In three, and possibly four, cases out of five there are one to two galaxies sharing the same redshift as the BL Lac. The environments are similar to Abell clusters of richness class O. Comparison with the environments of F-R I and II radio galaxies is briefly discussed.

An analysis of the richness of galaxies in the field shows that the source is located in a poor cluster of galaxies. Spectra of three galaxies indicate that they are at redshift z about 0.116, and the spectrum of the nebulosity surrounding the BL Lac object, yielding z = 0.116, shows that the BL Lac object belongs to the cluster. The galaxy environment of BL Lac objects, together with those of F-R I radio sources, the proposed parent objects in the beaming hypothesis, is briefly discussed.

AB  - An analysis of galaxies in the field of the BL Lac object H 0414+009 is presented. Direct images indicate that the BL Lac lies in a moderately rich cluster of galaxies, of which the galaxy hosting H 0414+009 is the dominant member. It is shown that a number of surrounding galaxies share the same redshift as the host galaxy of H 0414+009. Such an environment is consistent with those in which FR-I radio galaxies, the proposed parent population of BL Lac objects, are often found.

AB  - Aims: The BL Lac object RGB 1745+398 lies in an environment that makes it possible to study the cluster around it more deeply than the environments of other BL Lac objects. The cluster centered on the BL Lac works as a strong gravitational lens, forming a large arc around itself. The aim of this paper is to study the environment and characteristics of this object more accurately than the environments of other BL Lac objects have been before.  Methods: We measured the redshifts of galaxies in the cluster from the absorption lines in their spectra. The velocity dispersion was then obtained from the redshifts. The gravitational lensing was used for measuring the mass at the center of the cluster. The mass of the whole cluster could then be estimated using the softened isothermal sphere mass distribution. Finally, the richness of the cluster was determined by counting the number of galaxies near the BL Lac object and obtaining the galaxy-BL Lac spatial covariance function, B_gb.  Results: The redshifts of nine galaxies in the field were measured to be near the redshift of the BL Lac object, confirming the presence of a cluster. The average redshift of the cluster is 0.268, and the velocity dispersion (470^+190-110) km s-1. The mass of the cluster is M500 = (4^+3-2)×1014 Mo, which implies a rather massive cluster. The richness measurement also suggests that this is a rich cluster: the result for covariance function is B_gb = (600$\pm$200) Mpc1.77, which corresponds to Abell richness class 1 and which is consistent with the mass and velocity dispersion of the cluster.

AB  - We analyze the bivariate distribution, in color versus absolute magnitude (u-r vs. Mr), of a low-redshift sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (2400 deg2, 0.004<z<0.08, -23.5<Mr<-15.5). We trace the bimodality of the distribution from luminous to faint galaxies by fitting double Gaussians to the color functions separated in absolute magnitude bins. Color-magnitude (CM) relations are obtained for red and blue distributions (early- and late-type, predominantly field, galaxies) without using any cut in morphology. Instead, the analysis is based on the assumption of normal Gaussian distributions in color. We find that the CM relations are well fitted by a straight line plus a tanh function. Both relations can be described by a shallow CM trend (slopes of about -0.04, -0.05) plus a steeper transition in the average galaxy properties over about 2 mag. The midpoints of the transitions (Mr=-19.8 and -20.8 for the red and blue distributions, respectively) occur around 2×1010 Msolar after converting luminosities to stellar mass. Separate luminosity functions are obtained for the two distributions. The red distribution has a more luminous characteristic magnitude and a shallower faint-end slope (M*=-21.5, alpha=-0.8) compared to the blue distribution (alpha~-1.3, depending on the parameterization). These are approximately converted to galaxy stellar mass functions. The red distribution galaxies have a higher number density per magnitude for masses greater than about 3×1010 Msolar. Using a simple merger model, we show that the differences between the two functions are consistent with the red distribution being formed from major galaxy mergers.

AB  - We analyse a z < 0.1 galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey focusing on the variation in the galaxy colour bimodality with stellar mass and projected neighbour density Sigma, and on measurements of the galaxy stellar mass functions. The characteristic mass increases with environmental density from about 1010.6 to (Kroupa initial mass function, H0 = 70) for Sigma in the range 0.1-10Mpc-2. The galaxy population naturally divides into a red and blue sequence with the locus of the sequences in colour-mass and colour-concentration indices not varying strongly with environment. The fraction of galaxies on the red sequence is determined in bins of 0.2 in logSigma and bins). The red fraction fr generally increases continuously in both Sigma and such that there is a unified relation: . Two simple functions are proposed which provide good fits to the data. These data are compared with analogous quantities in semi-analytical models based on the Millennium N-body simulation: the Bower et al. and Croton et al. models that incorporate active galactic nucleus feedback. Both models predict a strong dependence of the red fraction on stellar mass and environment that is qualitatively similar to the observations. However, a quantitative comparison shows that the Bower et al. model is a significantly better match; this appears to be due to the different treatment of feedback in central galaxies.

AB  - Context: OH maser emission is known to be associated with high mass star forming regions. Towards some of these regions, OH masers are associated with HII regions. Towards others, believed to be in an earlier evolutionary state, OH masers are offset from HII regions. Towards these later regions, it is believed that OH masers are associated with the circumstellar disk (e.g. Edris et al. 2005; Gray et al. 2003). These disks should be hosting dense dust grains. The presence of the hot dust could be traced via the millimeter continuum emission as well as IR emission. Aims: studying the association between millimeter (mm) continuum, the OH masers emission, and IRAS sources. Methods: A sample of 27 High Mass Star Forming Regions (HMSFRs) chosen from IRAS catalog and show OH maser emission (Edris et. al. 2007) have been studied at 1.1 millimeter (mm) continuum emission of the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS). Results: The 1.1-mm continuum emission have been found within ~ 30' towards 23 sources of the OH maser sample. These sources were divided into three groups depends on the offset of the closest mm peak from the OH maser position. The association between the OH, mm and IR emissions types have been confirmed for two sources. Generally the IRAS position is more consistent with the mm peaks than the OH maser emission and towards 10 sources the IRAS and OH masers are not consistent with the same mm peak. Conclusion: The relatively large positional uncertainty do not allow to firm conclusions but it seems that the IR peak is closer to the mm emission than the OH maser.

AB  - We present a sample of 386 BL Lacertae candidates identified from 2860 deg2 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic database. The candidates are primarily selected to have quasi-featureless optical spectra and low proper motions as measured from SDSS and USNO-B positions; however, our ability to separate Galactic from extragalactic quasi-featureless objects (QFOs) on the basis of proper motion alone is limited by the lack of reliable proper motion measurements for faint objects. Fortunately, high proper motion QFOs, mostly DC white dwarfs, populate a well-defined region of color space, approximately corresponding to blackbodies with temperatures in the range 7000-12,000 K. QFOs with measurable redshifts or X-ray or radio counterparts (i.e., evidence of an extragalactic/active galactic nucleus nature) loosely follow a track in color space that corresponds to power-law continua plus host galaxy starlight, with typical power-law slopes in the range 1<alphaopt<2 (fnu~nu-alpha). Based largely on this remarkably clean color separation, we subdivide the sample into 240 probable candidates and 146 additional less probable (likely stellar) candidates. The probable BL Lac candidates have multiwavelength properties consistent with the range of previously known BL Lac objects, with an apparent preponderance of objects with synchrotron peaks at relatively high energies (HBL/XBL type). The majority of the 154 objects with measurable redshifts have z<1, with a median of 0.45; there are also a handful of high-redshift objects extending up to z=5.03. We identify a small number of potential radio-quiet BL Lac candidates, although more sensitive radio observations are needed to confirm their radio-quiet nature.

AB  - We analyse the relationships between galaxy morphology, colour, environment and stellar mass using data for over 105 objects from Galaxy Zoo, the largest sample of visually classified morphologies yet compiled. We conclusively show that colour and morphology fractions are very different functions of environment. Both colour and morphology are sensitive to stellar mass. However, at fixed stellar mass, while colour is also highly sensitive to environment, morphology displays much weaker environmental trends. Only a small part of both the morphology-density and colour-density relations can be attributed to the variation in the stellar-mass function with environment.  Galaxies with high stellar masses are mostly red in all environments and irrespective of their morphology. Low stellar-mass galaxies are mostly blue in low-density environments, but mostly red in high-density environments, again irrespective of their morphology. While galaxies with early-type morphology do always have higher red fractions, this is subdominant compared to the dependence of red fraction on stellar mass and environment. The colour-density relation is primarily driven by variations in colour fractions at fixed morphology, in particular the fraction of spiral galaxies that have red colours, and especially at low stellar masses. We demonstrate that our red spirals primarily include galaxies with true spiral morphology, and that they constitute an additional population to the S0 galaxies considered by previous studies. We clearly show there is an environmental dependence for colour beyond that for morphology. The environmental transformation of galaxies from blue to red must occur on significantly shorter time-scales than the transformation from spiral to early-type.  We also present many of our results as functions of the distance to the nearest galaxy group. This confirms that the environmental trends we present are not specific to the manner in which environment is quantified, but nevertheless provides plain evidence for an environmental process at work in groups. However, the properties of group members show little dependence on the total mass of the group they inhabit, at least for group masses .  Before using the Galaxy Zoo morphologies to produce the above results, we first quantify a luminosity-, size- and redshift-dependent classification bias that affects this data set, and probably most other studies of galaxy population morphology. A correction for this bias is derived and applied to produce a sample of galaxies with reliable morphological-type likelihoods, on which we base our analysis.  This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 100, 000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project.

AB  - Context: Although blazars make of a small fraction of the overall AGN population, they are expected to be the dominant population of extragalactic sources in the hard X-ray and gamma-ray bands and have been shown to be the largest contaminant of CMB fluctuation maps. So far the number of known blazars is of the order of several hundreds, but the forthcoming AGILE, GLAST and Planck space observatories will detect several thousand objects of this type.  Aims: In preparation for these missions it is necessary to identify new samples of blazars to study their multi-frequency characteristics and statistical properties. Methods: We compiled a sample of objects with blazar-like properties via a cross-correlation between large radio (NVSS, ATCAPMN) and X-ray surveys (RASS) using the SDSS-DR4 and 2dF survey data to spectroscopically identify our candidates and test the validity of the selection method.   Results: We present the Radio-Optical-X-ray catalog built at ASDC (ROXA), a list of 816 objects among which 510 are confirmed blazars. Only 19% of the candidates were certain non-blazars, demonstrating the high efficiency of our selection method. Conclusions: Our catalog includes 173 new blazar identifications, or about 10% of all presently known blazars. The relatively high flux threshold in the X-ray energy band (given by the RASS survey) preferentially selects objects with high f_x/fr ratio leading to the discovery of new High Energy Peaked BL Lac (HBLs). Our catalog therefore includes many new potential targets for GeV-TeV observations.  The catalog is only available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/472/699

AB  - The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) started a new phase in 2008 August, with new instrumentation and new surveys focused on Galactic structure and chemical evolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature in the clustering of galaxies and the quasar Lyalpha forest, and a radial velocity search for planets around ~8000 stars. This paper describes the first data release of SDSS-III (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the SDSS). The release includes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg2 in the southern Galactic cap, bringing the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg2, or over a third of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been reprocessed with an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometric recalibration and flat-field determination. This release also includes all data from the second phase of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars at both high and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million stellar spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed through an improved stellar parameter pipeline, which has better determination of metallicity for high-metallicity stars.

AB  - Morphology is a powerful indicator of a galaxy's dynamical and merger history. It is strongly correlated with many physical parameters, including mass, star formation history and the distribution of mass. The Galaxy Zoo project collected simple morphological classifications of nearly 900 000 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, contributed by hundreds of thousands of volunteers. This large number of classifications allows us to exclude classifier error, and measure the influence of subtle biases inherent in morphological classification. This paper presents the data collected by the project, alongside measures of classification accuracy and bias. The data are now publicly available and full catalogues can be downloaded in electronic format from . This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 100 000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. Their contributions are individually acknowledged at

AB  - An R and K' atlas of the IRAS 1 Jy sample of 118 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs) was presented in a companion paper (our Paper I). The present paper discusses the results from the analysis of these images supplemented with new spectroscopic data obtained at Keck. All but one object in the 1 Jy sample show signs of a strong tidal interaction/merger. Multiple mergers involving more than two galaxies are seen in no more than five of the 118 (<5%) systems. None of the 1 Jy sources is in the first-approach stage of the interaction, and most (56%) of them harbor a single disturbed nucleus and are therefore in the later stages of a merger. Seyfert galaxies (especially those of type 1), warm ULIGs (f25/f60>0.2), and the more luminous systems (>1012.5 Lsolar) all show a strong tendency to be advanced mergers with a single nucleus. The individual galaxies in the binary systems of the 1 Jy sample show a broad distribution in host magnitudes (luminosities) with a mean of -21.02+/-0.76 mag (0.85+0.86-0.43 L*) at R and -23.98+/-1.25 mag (0.90+1.94-0.61 L*) at K', and a R- or K'-band luminosity ratio generally less than ~4. Single-nucleus ULIGs also show a broad distribution in host magnitudes (luminosities) with an average of -21.77+/-0.92 mag (1.69+2.25-0.97 L*) at R and -25.03+/-0.94 mag (2.36+3.24-1.38) at K'. These distributions overlap considerably with those of quasars. The same statement applies to R-K' colors in ULIG and quasar hosts. An analysis of the surface brightness profiles of the host galaxies in single-nucleus sources reveals that about 73% of the R and K' surface brightness profiles are fitted adequately by an elliptical-like R1/4 law. These elliptical-like 1 Jy systems have luminosity and R-band axial ratio distributions that are similar to those of normal (inactive) intermediate-luminosity ellipticals and follow with some scatter the same mue-re relation, giving credence to the idea that some of these objects may eventually become intermediate-luminosity elliptical galaxies if they get rid of their excess gas or transform this gas into stars. These elliptical-like hosts are most common among merger remnants with Seyfert 1 nuclei (83%), Seyfert 2 optical characteristics (69%), or mid-infrared (ISO) AGN signatures (80%). The mean half-light radius of these ULIGs is 4.80+/-1.37 kpc at R and 3.48+/-1.39 kpc at K', typical of intermediate-luminosity ellipticals. These values are in excellent agreement with recent quasar measurements obtained at H with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), but they are systematically lower than other HST measurements derived at R. The reason for this discrepancy between the two quasar data sets is not known. In general, the results from the present study are consistent with the merger-driven evolutionary sequence ``cool ULIGs-->warm ULIGs-->quasars.'' However, many exceptions appear to exist to this simple picture (e.g., 46% of the 41 advanced mergers show no obvious signs of Seyfert activity). This underlines the importance of using a large homogeneous sample like the 1 Jy sample to draw statistically meaningful conclusions; the problems of small sample size and/or inhomogeneous selection criteria have plagued many studies of luminous infrared galaxies in the past.

AB  - We report the results from a deep HST NICMOS H-band imaging survey of a carefully selected sample of 33 luminous, late-stage galactic mergers at z<0.3. This program is part of QUEST (Quasar/ULIRG Evolutionary Study). Signs of a recent galactic interaction are seen in all of these objects, including all seven IR-excess Palomar-Green (PG) QSOs in the sample. Unsuspected double nuclei are detected in five ULIRGs. A detailed two-dimensional analysis of the surface brightness distributions in these objects indicates that the great majority (81%) of the single-nucleus systems show a prominent early-type morphology. However, low-surface-brightness exponential disks are detected on large scales in at least four of these sources. The hosts of ``warm'' (IRAS 25 to 60 mum flux ratio f25/f60>0.2), AGN-like systems are of early type and have less pronounced merger-induced morphological anomalies than the hosts of cool systems with LINER or H II region-like nuclear optical spectral types. The host sizes and luminosities of the seven PG QSOs in our sample are statistically indistinguishable from those of the ULIRG hosts. The hosts of ULIRGs and PG QSOs lie close to the locations of intermediate-size (~1L*-2L*) spheroids in the photometric projection of the fundamental plane of ellipticals, although there is a tendency for the ULIRGs with small hosts to be brighter than normal spheroids. The black hole masses derived from the galaxy host luminosities imply sub-Eddington accretion rates for all objects in the sample.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.

AB  - We present deep images for 34 out of a new sample of 36 ultraluminous Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) galaxies (ULGs), as well as seven additional high-luminosity objects, selected from the North Galactic Wedge selected area and QDOT all-sky redshift surveys. Previous charge coupled device (CCD) data and Sky Survey material are used in the examination of the two remaining ULGs. All but one of the 43 high-luminosity and ultraluminous IRAS galaxies are classified according to the seven-band system of Lawrence et al., with the exception being unclassifiable due to the proximity of a bright star. Of the total usable sample of 42, we find that 28/42 (67 per cent) are interacting or merging, 4/42 (10 per cent) are in a close pairing but show no obvious signs of an interaction, and 10/42 (23 per cent) are isolated or have only distant companions. Given the clear preponderance of merging systems in infrared-luminous objects, the existence of a substantial fraction of exceptions is interesting. The starburst trigger in these cases is unknown. We discuss spectroscopic data on the galaxies and present new spectra of two objects.

AB  - We present the results of R-band imaging observations of a sample of 60 ultraluminous IRAS galaxies (ULIRGs). All the objects are taken from our ULIRG survey. The bulk of these objects are in a magnitude-limited subsample of this survey with B_J<19.5, consisting of 56 objects. We find that 51 of the 56 main-sample objects (91 per cent) are merging and/or disturbed systems, whilst four of the remaining five have close, usually disturbed, companions. Only one of the main sample of objects is isolated and quiescent. The result that almost all of these ULIRGs are disturbed systems contradicts some of the earlier observations. We consider possible origins for this discrepancy, and conclude that deeper images of isolated and quiescent ULIRGs may well reveal previously undetected signs of disturbance.

AB  - A simple cosmological model with only six parameters (matter density, Omegamh2, baryon density, Omegabh2, Hubble constant, H0, amplitude of fluctuations, sigma8, optical depth, tau, and a slope for the scalar perturbation spectrum, ns) fits not only the 3 year WMAP temperature and polarization data, but also small-scale CMB data, light element abundances, large-scale structure observations, and the supernova luminosity/distance relationship. Using WMAP data only, the best-fit values for cosmological parameters for the power-law flat Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model are (Omegamh2,Omegabh2,h,ns,tau,sigma8)=(0.1277+0.0080-0.0079,0.02229+/-0.00073,0.732+0.031-0.032,0.958+/-0.016,0.089+/-0.030,0.761+0.049-0.048). The 3 year data dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six-dimensional parameter space. Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power-law spectrum, the WMAP data alone require dark matter and favor a spectral index that is significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant spectrum (ns=1, r=0). Adding additional data sets improves the constraints on these components and the spectral slope. For power-law models, WMAP data alone puts an improved upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r0.002<0.65 (95% CL) and the combination of WMAP and the lensing-normalized SDSS galaxy survey implies r0.002<0.30 (95% CL). Models that suppress large-scale power through a running spectral index or a large-scale cutoff in the power spectrum are a better fit to the WMAP and small-scale CMB data than the power-law LambdaCDM model; however, the improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only Deltachi2=3 for 1 extra degree of freedom. Models with a running-spectral index are consistent with a higher amplitude of gravity waves. In a flat universe, the combination of WMAP and the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) data yields a significant constraint on the equation of state of the dark energy, w=-0.967+0.073-0.072. If we assume w=-1, then the deviations from the critical density, OmegaK, are small: the combination of WMAP and the SNLS data implies Omegak=-0.011+/-0.012. The combination of WMAP 3 year data plus the HST Key Project constraint on H0 implies Omegak=-0.014+/-0.017 and OmegaLambda=0.716+/-0.055. Even if we do not include the prior that the universe is flat, by combining WMAP, large-scale structure, and supernova data, we can still put a strong constraint on the dark energy equation of state, w=-1.08+/-0.12. For a flat universe, the combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yield a constraint on the sum of the neutrino masses, Sigmamnu<0.66 eV (95%CL). Consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary theories, we detect no significant deviations from Gaussianity in the CMB maps using Minkowski functionals, the bispectrum, trispectrum, and a new statistic designed to detect large-scale anisotropies in the fluctuations.

AB  - From a survey for the redshifted H I 21-cm and OH 18-cm absorption in the hosts of a sample of radio galaxies and quasars, we detect H I in three of the 10 and OH in none of the 14 sources for which useful data were obtained. As expected from our recent result, all of the 21-cm detections occur in sources with ultraviolet (UV) continuum luminosities of LUV<= 1023 W Hz-1. At these `moderate' luminosities, we also obtain four non-detections, although, as confirmed by the equipartition of detections between the type 1 and type 2 objects, this near-50 per cent detection rate cannot be attributed to unified schemes of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). All of our detections are at redshifts of z≲ 0.67, which, in conjunction with our faint source selection, biases against UV luminous objects. The importance of the UV luminosity (over AGN type) in the detection of the 21-cm absorption is further supported by the non-detections in the two high-redshift (z˜ 3.6-3.8) radio galaxies, which are both type 2 objects, while having LUV > 1023 W Hz-1. Our 21-cm detections in combination with those previously published give a total of eight (associated and intervening) H I-absorbing sources searched and undetected in OH. Using the detected 21-cm line strengths to normalize the limits, we find that only two of these eight sources may have been searched sufficiently deeply in OH, even though these are marginal.

AB  - We measure black hole masses for 71 BL Lac objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with redshifts out to z˜ 0.4. We perform spectral decompositions of their nuclei from their host galaxies and measure their stellar velocity dispersions. Black hole masses are then derived from the black hole mass - stellar velocity dispersion relation. We find BL Lac objects host black holes of similar masses, ˜108.5 Mo, with a dispersion of $\pm$0.4 dex, similar to the uncertainties on each black hole measurement. Therefore, all BL Lac objects in our sample have the same indistinguishable black hole mass. These 71 BL Lac objects follow the black hole mass-bulge luminosity relation, and their narrow range of host galaxy luminosities confirm previous claims that BL Lac host galaxies can be treated as standard candles. We conclude that the observed diversity in the shapes of BL Lac object spectral energy distributions is not strongly driven by black hole mass or host galaxy properties.

AB  - We present a large sample of 501 radio-selected BL Lac candidates from a combination of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 optical spectroscopy and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) radio survey; this is one of the largest BL Lac samples yet assembled, and each object emerges with homogeneous data coverage. Each candidate is detected in the radio from FIRST and confirmed in SDSS optical spectroscopy to have (1) no emission feature with measured rest-equivalent width larger than 5 Å and (2) no measured Ca II H/K depression larger than 40%. We subdivide our sample into 426 higher-confidence candidates and 75 lower-confidence candidates. We argue that contamination from other classes of objects that formally pass our selection criteria is small, and we identify a few very-rare radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with unusual spectra that are probably related to broad absorption line quasars. About one-fifth of our sample were known BL Lac objects prior to the SDSS. A preliminary analysis of the sample generally supports the standard beaming paradigm. While we recover sizable numbers of low-energy and intermediate-energy cutoff BL Lac objects (LBLs and IBLs, respectively), there are indications of a potential bias toward recovering high-energy cutoff BL Lac objects (HBLs) from SDSS spectroscopy. Such a large sample may eventually provide new constraints on BL Lac unification models and their potentially peculiar cosmic evolution; in particular, our sample contains a significant number of higher redshift objects, a sub-population for which the standard paradigm has yet to be rigorously constrained.

AB  - We review how the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will address fundamental questions in cosmology, focussing on its use for neutral Hydrogen (HI) surveys. A key enabler of its unique capabilities will be large (but smart) receptors in the form of aperture arrays. We outline the likely contributions of Phase-1 of the SKA (SKA1), Phase-2 SKA (SKA2) and pathfinding activities (SKA0). We emphasise the important role of cross-correlation between SKA HI results and those at other wavebands such as: surveys for objects in the EoR with VISTA and the SKA itself; and huge optical and near-infrared redshift surveys, such as those with HETDEX and Euclid. We note that the SKA will contribute in other ways to cosmology, e.g. through gravitational lensing and $H_0$ studies.

AB  - This dynamical model for the 28 galaxies with distances less than 1.5 Mpc, and not apparently tight satellites, is constrained by the initial condition that peculiar velocities at high redshift are small and growing in accordance with the standard cosmology. The solution is a satisfactory fit to most of the measured redshifts, distances, and proper motions, with some interesting exceptions that call for further investigation. The model predicts Milky Way rotation speed 256 km/s, consistent with Reid et al. (2009a). Ten Local Group galaxies emanate from low supergalactic latitude and supergalactic longitude ~ 70 degrees, perhaps as remnants from failed assembly of a larger galaxy. NGC 6822 passes close to the Milky Way at redshift ~0.27, in an orbit similar to the Magellanic Clouds. Leo I has heliocentric angular velocity 0.33 mas/yr, perhaps measurable by the mean stellar motion, and 15 galaxies have proper motions greater than 0.05 mas/yr, measurable for any with masers.

AB  - The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscrued by optically thick circumstellar matter, particularly at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. In radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit radio through gamma-ray light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anistropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which includes radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and general properties of AGN. We summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission caused by circumstellar obscuration and relativistic beaming. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking the high-luminosity sources (BL Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies). Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN and conclude they probably are powered by similar physical processes, at least within the relativistic jet. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this field. (SECTION: Invited Review Paper)

AB  - We present results from the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectral mapping observations of 15 local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs). In this paper, we investigate the spatial variations of the mid-IR emission which includes fine structure lines, molecular hydrogen lines, polycyclic aromatic features (PAHs), continuum emission, and the 9.7 mum silicate feature. We also compare the nuclear and integrated spectra. We find that the star formation takes place in extended regions (several kpc) as probed by the PAH emission, as well as the [Ne II]12.81 mum and [Ne III]15.56 mum emissions. The behavior of the integrated PAH emission and 9.7 mum silicate feature is similar to that of local starburst galaxies. We also find that the minima of the [Ne III]15.56 mum/[Ne II]12.81 mum ratio tends to be located at the nuclei and its value is lower than that of H II regions in our LIRGs and nearby galaxies. It is likely that increased densities in the nuclei of LIRGs are responsible for the smaller nuclear [Ne III]15.56 mum/[Ne II]12.81 mum ratios. This includes the possibility that some of the most massive stars in the nuclei are still embedded in ultracompact H II regions. In a large fraction of our sample, the 11.3 mum PAH emission appears more extended than the dust 5.5 mum continuum emission. We find a dependency of the 11.3 mum PAH/7.7 mum PAH and [Ne II]12.81 mum/11.3 mum PAH ratios with the age of the stellar populations. Smaller and larger ratios, respectively, indicate recent star formation. The estimated warm (300 K <T< 1000 K) molecular hydrogen masses are of the order of 108 M sun, which are similar to those found in ULIRGs, local starbursts, and Seyfert galaxies. Finally we find that the [Ne II]12.81 mum velocity fields for most of the LIRGs in our sample are compatible with a rotating disk at ~kpc scales, and they are in a good agreement with Halpha velocity fields.  This work is based on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under NASA contract 1407.

AB  - We present a comparison of Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) data for 51 OH megamaser (OHM) hosts and 15 non-masing ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). 10%-25% of the OHMs show evidence for the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), significantly lower than the estimated AGN fraction from previous optical and radio studies. Non-masing ULIRGs have a higher AGN fraction (50%-95%) than OHMs, although some galaxies in both samples show evidence of co-existing starbursts and AGNs. Radiative transfer models of the dust environment reveal that non-masing galaxies tend to have clumpy dust geometries commonly associated with AGN, while OHMs have deeper absorption consistent with a smooth, thick dust shell. Statistical analyses show that the major differences between masing and non-masing ULIRGs in the mid-IR relate to the optical depth and dust temperature, which we measure using the 9.7 μm silicate depth and 30-20 μm spectral slope from the IRS data. Dust temperatures of 40-80 K derived from the IRS data are consistent with predictions of OH pumping models and with a minimum T dust required for maser production. The best-fit dust opacities (τ V ~ 100-400), however, are nearly an order of magnitude larger than those predicted for OH inversion, and suggest that modifications to the model may be required. These diagnostics offer the first detailed test of an OHM pumping model based only on the properties of its host galaxy and provide important restrictions on the physical conditions relevant to OHM production.

AB  - We present mid-infrared spectra and photometry from the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope for 51 OH megamasers (OHMs), along with 15 galaxies confirmed to have no megamaser emission above L OH = 10 2.3 L ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] sun . The majority of galaxies display moderate-to-deep 9.7 μm amorphous silicate absorption, with OHM galaxies showing stronger average absorption and steeper 20-30 μm continuum emission than non-masing galaxies. Emission from multiple polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), especially at 6.2, 7.7, and 11.3 μm, is detected in almost all systems. Fine-structure atomic emission (including [Ne II ], [Ne III ], [S III ], and [S IV ]) and multiple H 2 rotational transitions are observed in more than 90% of the sample. A subset of galaxies show emission from rarer atomic lines, such as [Ne V ], [O IV ], and [Fe II ]. Fifty percent of the OHMs show absorption from water ice and hydrogenated amorphous carbon grains, while absorption features from CO 2 , HCN, C 2 H 2 , and crystalline silicates are also seen in several OHMs. Column densities of OH derived from 34.6 μm OH absorption are similar to those derived from 1667 MHz OH absorption in non-masing galaxies, indicating that the abundance of masing molecules is similar for both samples. This data paper presents full mid-infrared spectra for each galaxy, along with measurements of line fluxes and equivalent widths, absorption feature depths, and spectral indices.

AB  - We present the first results of a ground-based program to determine the proper motion of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) relative to background quasars (QSO), being carried out using the Irenee du Pont 2.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. Eleven QSO fields have been targeted in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) over a time base of six years, and with seven epochs of observation. One quasar field was targeted in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), over a time base of five years, and with six epochs of observation. The shorter time base in the case of the LMC is compensated by the much larger amount of high-quality astrometry frames that could be secured for the LMC quasar field (124 frames), compared to the SMC fields (an average of roughly 45 frames). In this paper, we present final results for field Q0557-6713 in the LMC and field Q0036-7227 in the SMC. From field Q0557-6713, we have obtained a measured proper motion of macos d = +1.95 +- 0.13 mas yr-1, md = +0.43 +- 0.18 mas yr-1 for the LMC. From field Q0036-7227, we have obtained a measured proper motion of ma cosd = +0.95 +- 0.29 mas yr-1, md = -1.14 +- 0.18 mas yr-1 for the SMC. Although we went through the full procedure for another SMC field (QJ0036-7225), on account of unsolvable astrometric difficulties caused by blending of the QSO image, it was impossible to derive a reliable proper motion. Current model rotation curves for the plane of the LMC indicate that the rotational velocity (V rot) at the position of LMC field Q0557-6713 can be as low as 50 km s-1, or as high as 120 km s-1. A correction for perspective and rotation effects leads to a center of mass proper motion for the LMC of ma cosd = +1.82 +- 0.13 mas yr-1, md = +0.39 +- 0.15 mas yr-1 (V rot = 50 km s-1), and to ma cosd = +1.61 +- 0.13 mas yr-1, md = +0.60 +- 0.15 mas yr-1 (V rot = 120 km s-1). Assuming that the SMC has a disk-like central structure, but that it does not rotate, we obtain a center of mass proper motion for the SMC of ma cosd = +1.03 +- 0.29 mas yr-1, md = -1.09 +- 0.18 mas yr-1. Our results are in reasonable agreement with most previous determinations of the proper motion of the MCs, including recent Hubble Space Telescope measurements. Complemented with published values of the radial velocity of the centers of the LMC and SMC, we have used our proper motions to derive the galactocentric (gc) velocity components of the MCs. For the LMC, we obtain V gc,t = +315 +- 20 km s-1, V gc,r = +86 +- 17 km s-1 (V rot = 50 km s-1), and V gc,t = +280 +- 24 km s-1, V gc,r = +94 +- 17 km s-1 (V rot = 120 km s-1). For the SMC, we obtain V gc,t = +258 +- 50 km s-1, V gc,r = +20 +- 44 km s-1. These velocities imply a relative velocity between the LMC and SMC of 84 +- 50 km s-1, for V rot,LMC = 50 km s-1, and 62 +- 63 km s-1 for V rot,LMC = 120 km s-1. Albeit our large errors, these values are not inconsistent with the standard assumption that the MCs are gravitationally bound to each other.
